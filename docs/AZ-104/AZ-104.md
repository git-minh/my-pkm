Explain how VNet peering works and mention one of its limitations.

Answer: VNet peering connects two Azure VNets, allowing resources to communicate directly using private IP addresses. It uses the Azure backbone network for low-latency connectivity. A limitation is that peering is non-transitive by default, meaning if VNet A is peered with VNet B and VNet B is peered with VNet C, VNet A cannot communicate with VNet C through VNet B.
What is the purpose of Azure Network Watcher's IP Flow Verify tool?

Answer: The IP Flow Verify tool checks whether traffic is allowed or denied to or from a VM based on NSG rules. It helps in troubleshooting connectivity issues by simulating traffic flow and indicating which rule is affecting the traffic.
How can you ensure that traffic to your web application is always directed to the closest Azure region for users worldwide?

Answer: Use Azure Traffic Manager with the 'Performance' routing method to direct user requests to the Azure endpoint with the lowest network latency, typically the closest region to the user's DNS resolver.

Discuss Practice Scenarios: I can provide hypothetical scenarios to apply your knowledge.

Thought for 39 seconds
Certainly! Let's dive into some hypothetical scenarios that will help you apply your knowledge of Azure services and prepare for the AZ-104 exam. These scenarios are designed to mimic real-world situations you might encounter as an Azure Administrator.

Scenario 1: Implementing Azure Virtual Networking
Background:

Contoso Ltd. is migrating its on-premises infrastructure to Azure. They have the following requirements:

Create a secure network infrastructure in Azure that mimics their on-premises network.
Set up virtual networks (VNets) in two different regions: East US and West Europe.
The VNets must communicate securely with each other over the Azure backbone network.
Ensure that VMs in both VNets can resolve each other's hostnames.
Implement network security controls to restrict traffic between subnets.
Tasks:
Design the Virtual Network Architecture:

Determine the address spaces and subnets for both VNets, ensuring no IP address conflicts.
Decide how to connect the VNets securely.
Configure Name Resolution:

Enable cross-VNet name resolution so that VMs can resolve each other's hostnames.
Implement Network Security:

Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic between subnets.
Utilize Application Security Groups (ASGs) to simplify NSG management.
Questions:
How would you set up VNet peering between the East US and West Europe VNets?

What methods can you use to enable VMs in different VNets to resolve each other's hostnames?

Explain how NSGs and ASGs can be used together to manage network security.

Answers and Explanations:
Setting Up VNet Peering:

Create VNets in both East US and West Europe regions with non-overlapping IP address spaces (e.g., East US VNet: 10.0.0.0/16, West Europe VNet: 10.1.0.0/16).
In the Azure portal, navigate to the East US VNet.
Select "Peerings" and click "Add".
Enter a name for the peering from East US to West Europe.
Choose the West Europe VNet as the peering target.
Enable the options for "Allow virtual network access".
Repeat the steps from the West Europe VNet to create a peering back to the East US VNet.
Ensure bidirectional peering is established.
Enabling Cross-VNet Name Resolution:

Option 1: Azure DNS Private Zones
Create an Azure Private DNS Zone (e.g., contoso.local).
Link both VNets to the DNS zone.
Configure VMs to use the Azure-provided DNS or specify the private DNS zone in their DNS settings.
Enable auto-registration of VM hostnames if desired.
Option 2: Custom DNS Servers
Deploy a DNS server (e.g., Windows Server with DNS role) in Azure.
Configure the VNets to use the custom DNS server.
Ensure the DNS server can resolve names across VNets.
Using NSGs and ASGs:

Network Security Groups (NSGs):
Create NSGs and associate them with subnets or network interfaces.
Define inbound and outbound security rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Application Security Groups (ASGs):
Create ASGs representing application tiers (e.g., web servers, database servers).
Assign VM network interfaces to the appropriate ASGs.
In NSG rules, use ASGs as source or destination to simplify management.
Example:
Create an NSG rule allowing traffic from the ASG WebServers to AppServers on port 80.
Scenario 2: Managing Azure Storage
Background:

Fabrikam Inc. needs to store large amounts of data in Azure for their data analytics platform. Their requirements are:

Use Azure Blob Storage to store data files.
Optimize costs by automatically moving infrequently accessed data to a cooler storage tier.
Secure the storage account so that only their VMs can access it.
Provide temporary access to external partners to upload data without sharing access keys.
Tasks:
Configure Storage Tiers:

Implement a lifecycle management policy to move blobs to the cool tier after 30 days of inactivity.
Secure Access to the Storage Account:

Restrict access to the storage account using Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints or private endpoints.
Provide Temporary Access:

Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token with limited permissions and share it with external partners.
Questions:
What steps are involved in setting up a lifecycle management policy for Blob Storage?

How do VNet service endpoints and private endpoints differ in securing storage account access?

What best practices should be followed when creating a SAS token?

Answers and Explanations:
Setting Up Lifecycle Management Policy:

Navigate to the storage account in the Azure portal.
Under "Blob service," select "Lifecycle management."
Click "Add rule" to create a new policy.
Define the rule name and specify the scope (all blobs or specific containers/prefixes).
Set the filter conditions if needed.
Add an action to move blobs to the cool tier when the last modified date is more than 30 days ago.
Review and save the policy.
Securing Storage Account Access:

VNet Service Endpoints:
Enable service endpoints for Azure Storage on the VNets where the VMs are located.
In the storage account's "Firewalls and virtual networks" settings, allow access from the selected VNets.
Service endpoints extend your VNet to the Azure service over the Azure backbone network.
Private Endpoints:
Create a private endpoint for the storage account in your VNet.
This assigns a private IP address to the storage account within your VNet.
Provides secure connectivity without traversing the public internet.
Requires updating DNS settings to resolve the storage account's name to the private IP.
Best Practices for SAS Tokens:

Least Privilege: Grant only the permissions necessary (e.g., Write and Create for uploading).
Expiry Time: Set a short expiration time appropriate for the task.
IP Restrictions: Limit access to specific IP addresses or ranges if possible.
Protocol Enforcement: Use HTTPS only to ensure data encryption in transit.
Secure Distribution: Share the SAS token securely, avoiding exposure in insecure channels.
Scenario 3: Deploying and Managing Azure Compute Resources
Background:

Tailwind Traders needs to deploy a scalable web application. Their requirements are:

Use Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) to handle variable traffic loads.
Automatically scale out when CPU usage exceeds 75% and scale in when it drops below 30%.
Implement an Azure Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic.
Deploy a custom application on each VM instance during provisioning.
Tasks:
Configure VM Scale Set Autoscaling:

Set up autoscaling rules based on CPU usage thresholds.
Implement Load Balancing:

Deploy an Azure Load Balancer and associate it with the VMSS.
Deploy Custom Application:

Use the Custom Script Extension to install the application during VM provisioning.
Questions:
How do you create autoscale rules for a VMSS in the Azure portal?

What are the key components required to set up an Azure Load Balancer with a VMSS?

Explain how the Custom Script Extension works for deploying applications.

Answers and Explanations:
Creating Autoscale Rules:

In the Azure portal, navigate to the VM Scale Set.
Select "Scaling" under "Settings."
Click "Add a rule" to create a new autoscale rule.
Scale Out Rule:
Metric: Percentage CPU
Condition: Greater than 75%
Duration: Over the last 5 minutes
Action: Increase instance count by 1
Cooldown Period: 5 minutes
Scale In Rule:
Metric: Percentage CPU
Condition: Less than 30%
Duration: Over the last 5 minutes
Action: Decrease instance count by 1
Cooldown Period: 5 minutes
Setting Up Azure Load Balancer:

Frontend IP Configuration: Assign a public IP address for external access.
Backend Pool: Automatically includes VM instances from the VMSS.
Health Probes: Define probes to monitor VM health (e.g., TCP or HTTP probe on port 80).
Load Balancing Rules: Map frontend ports to backend ports (e.g., port 80 to port 80).
Integration with VMSS: When creating the VMSS, specify the load balancer and backend pool.
Using Custom Script Extension:

The Custom Script Extension allows you to execute scripts on VMs after they are provisioned.
Process:
Script Location: Store the script in an accessible location (e.g., Azure Storage, GitHub).
Extension Configuration: Provide the script URI and any necessary parameters during VMSS deployment.
Execution: The extension downloads and runs the script on each VM instance.
Use Cases: Install applications, configure settings, or perform post-deployment tasks.
Scenario 4: Monitoring and Backing Up Azure Resources
Background:

Adventure Works wants to ensure high availability and disaster recovery for their critical applications. Their requirements are:

Monitor VMs for performance issues and receive alerts when CPU usage is high.
Implement daily backups for VMs with a 30-day retention policy.
Set up Azure Site Recovery to replicate VMs to a secondary region for disaster recovery.
Test the failover process without affecting production workloads.
Tasks:
Configure Azure Monitor and Alerts:

Set up metric alerts for CPU usage exceeding 80%.
Action Groups: Notify the IT team via email and SMS.
Implement VM Backups:

Use Azure Backup to schedule daily backups.
Configure a Recovery Services Vault.
Set Up Azure Site Recovery (ASR):

Enable replication of VMs to a secondary region.
Perform a test failover to validate the disaster recovery plan.
Questions:
How do you create a metric alert in Azure Monitor for high CPU usage?

What steps are involved in setting up Azure Backup for VMs?

Explain the process of performing a test failover using Azure Site Recovery.

Answers and Explanations:
Creating a Metric Alert:

Navigate to the Azure Monitor service.

Questions:
How do you enable Azure MFA for all users in Azure AD?

What steps are involved in creating a Conditional Access policy to require MFA for certain applications?

Explain how Azure Policy can audit non-compliant resources and how you would implement it for VMs without managed disks.

What is the principle of least privilege, and how does it apply when assigning Azure AD roles?

Answers and Explanations:
Enabling Azure MFA:

Navigate to Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal.
Select "Users" and then "Per-user MFA."
Enable MFA for all users by selecting them and choosing "Enable."
Alternatively, use Conditional Access policies to enforce MFA without enabling per-user MFA.
Exclude service accounts by adding them to an exclusion group or policy exception.
Creating a Conditional Access Policy:

In Azure Active Directory, select "Security" and then "Conditional Access."
Click "New policy."
Name: Provide a meaningful name.
Assignments:
Users and Groups: Select "All users" or specific users/groups.
Cloud Apps or Actions: Select the applications that require MFA.
Conditions: Configure conditions like sign-in risk if needed.
Access Controls:
Grant: Require "Require multi-factor authentication."
Enable Policy: Set the policy to "On."
Create the policy.
Implementing Azure Policy for Compliance Auditing:

Go to "Policy" in the Azure portal.
Under "Definitions," search for the built-in policy "Audit VMs that do not use managed disks."
Click "Assign" to assign the policy.
Scope: Choose the subscription or resource group.
Parameters: No parameters are needed for this policy.
Remediation: Optionally create a remediation task to fix non-compliant resources.
Assign the policy.
The policy will audit existing VMs and report on compliance.
Principle of Least Privilege:

Definition: Assigning the minimum necessary permissions to users or roles to perform their job functions.
Application in Azure AD Roles:
Assign roles like "User Administrator" or "Global Reader" instead of "Global Administrator" unless absolutely necessary.
Regularly review role assignments to ensure they are still appropriate.
Use Administrative Units to limit the scope of roles to specific departments or regions.
