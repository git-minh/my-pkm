# Foundations of Agile and Agile Frameworks


# The History of Agile

## Where Did Agile Come From?

Much like other paradigm shifts in the business world, agile came into existence based on a business need.

Agile emerged organically as a result of a market need to deal with the crisis product development faced in the 1990s. Back in the 1990s, it was taking somewhere in the range of 2-4 years to get a software solution to production from the time it was conceived as a valuable business need. This delay was just not acceptable for enterprise business users. The market had started to evolve and it was beginning to be realized that both the needs and expectations from the business users would not remain static for so long.

A growing number of experts felt that there had to be a better way to build products with a focus on:

- business users, and
- business value.

### History of Agile

In the Spring of 2000, a group of industry experts gathered in Oregon to come up with some common ground on Agile. This meeting led to a famous gathering in Utah in February 2001 where 17 thought leaders finalized **The Agile Manifesto**. This historic gathering set the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

Since Agile was developed for software development, many think that software is the only place where Agile is valuable. However, today Agile is being applied in all industries across the globe.

# Agile Tools

## What Tools Do Agile Teams Use?

### Key Points

Agile tools are excellent communication and collaboration resources. So, for example, they:

- Help monitor the teams’ progress in a transparent and visible manner
- Can be customized to accommodate Agile teams in various industries with different Agile frameworks
- Provide real-time dashboards and reports that show the Agile team’s progress against the product roadmap

What We Will Cover In This Lesson


## Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile Part 1

So, why are forward-thinking organizations rapidly adopting Agile? And why are we seeing that global professional bodies such as The Project Management Institute (PMI) in their PMBOK Guide and The International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA)’s BABOK Guide, have incorporated and highlighted the importance of Agile in project management, business analysis, and other product delivery activities?

In an increasingly interconnected and competitive global marketplace, I am seeing Agile being leveraged by successful organizations across the globe to thrive in today’s digital age. Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value in a world where we are constantly being challenged with Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. Organizations that I have seen go through Agile transformation have benefited from the following:

- Faster time to market
- Early ROI
- Feedback from Real Customers

![Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile? Because of the challenges of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03d5b8_agndl1-why-agile/agndl1-why-agile.jpg)

Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity

_Note: You are going to learn more about VUCA later in this lesson._

## Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile Part 2

### Organizations that go through Agile transformation have also benefited from:

- Build the right products
- Early risk reduction
- Built-in quality
- Culture and morale

## Efficiency vs. Effectiveness

### Efficiency and effectiveness is a fine balancing act that Agile recommends.

If you’re only focused on going fast, you prioritize efficiency.

If you’re trying to focus on innovation, creativity, and making sure you’re working on the right thing, you need to focus on effectiveness.

This is often done at the cost of efficiency.

Agile ensures a balanced approach whereby Agile Teams ensure there is a balance between speed and creativity.

Agile transformations also benefit from:

- Customer Satisfaction
- Alignment
- Emergent Outcomes
- Predictability

Organizations want to use Agile to get there by developing products better, faster, and cheaper.

# How Experts Approach Agile

## Thinking About Agile

### Agile Is Based on a Systems Thinking Approach and a Growth Mindset

- Agilists adopt a practical and realistic approach to delivering the best value, and quality, in the shortest sustainable time.
- A Systems Thinking approach, reinforced by a Growth Mindset, helps Agile experts deliver optimal business value.
- Systems thinking takes a holistic approach in which the Agile Team looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution.
- In a growth mindset, individuals on a team have the mindset that their abilities can grow through dedication and hard work.

![Systems Thinking + Growth Mindset = Optimal Business Value](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03d9a3_agnd-c1-experts/agnd-c1-experts.jpg)

### New Terms

- **Growth Mindset**: The mindset that an individual's abilities can grow through dedication and hard work

    In this book, Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne share how one of the world's largest and most powerful companies leverages Agile practices to overcome today's challenges in the global marketplace.

# The Agile Mindset

## What Is the Agile Mindset?

### Agile permits teams to flourish in an environment that is increasingly Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous, also known as VUCA.

- Volatility is when there are unexpected or unstable possibilities that may influence the work being done
- Uncertainty refers to the extent to which an organization can confidently predict or forecast the future
- Complexity exists when there are many interconnected parts and variables that influence each other
- Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity, such as not having a clear understanding of the genuine needs of the customer and end-users

Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity (VUCA)

### Business Agility

Agile is a set of principles that guide how we as individuals, as teams and as organizations think about, as well as act upon, the work that we do.

Business agility is the ability of an organization to:

- Adapt quickly to market changes
- Respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense
- Adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality

### The Agile Mindset

When we talk about an Agile Mindset, we include:

- Respect
- Collaboration
- Continuous Improvement
- Iterative Learning Cycles
- Mastery and Ownership
- Focus on Delivering Value
- Adaptability to Change

![The Agile Mindset](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03dc0e_agnd-c1-l1-agile-mindset/agnd-c1-l1-agile-mindset.jpg)

The Agile Mindset

### Doing Agile vs. Being Agile

Some organizations and Agile Teams unfortunately just focus on Doing Agile. This equates to simply adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting agile principles and values.

Being Agile is the foundation that truly elevates individuals, teams, and organizations to unleash their latent potential to deliver monumental and focused value.

### New Terms

- **Agile Mindset**: The set of attitudes supporting an agile working environment
- **Being Agile**: When an Agile team lives & breathes Agile principles and values through Agile practices consistently every day
- **Business Agility**: The ability of an organization to adapt quickly to market changes, respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense, as well as adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality
- **Doing Agile**: When an Agile team adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting Agile principles and values

### Additional Resources

    This book clearly articulates how the missing piece in successfully transforming organizations to Agile is the Agile Mindset.
