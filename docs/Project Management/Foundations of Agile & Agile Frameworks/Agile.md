# 1. Foundations of Agile and Agile Frameworks


# The History of Agile

## Where Did Agile Come From?

Much like other paradigm shifts in the business world, agile came into existence based on a business need.

Agile emerged organically as a result of a market need to deal with the crisis product development faced in the 1990s. Back in the 1990s, it was taking somewhere in the range of 2-4 years to get a software solution to production from the time it was conceived as a valuable business need. This delay was just not acceptable for enterprise business users. The market had started to evolve and it was beginning to be realized that both the needs and expectations from the business users would not remain static for so long.

A growing number of experts felt that there had to be a better way to build products with a focus on:

- business users, and
- business value.

### History of Agile

In the Spring of 2000, a group of industry experts gathered in Oregon to come up with some common ground on Agile. This meeting led to a famous gathering in Utah in February 2001 where 17 thought leaders finalized **The Agile Manifesto**. This historic gathering set the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

Since Agile was developed for software development, many think that software is the only place where Agile is valuable. However, today Agile is being applied in all industries across the globe.

# Agile Tools

## What Tools Do Agile Teams Use?

### Key Points

Agile tools are excellent communication and collaboration resources. So, for example, they:

- Help monitor the teams’ progress in a transparent and visible manner
- Can be customized to accommodate Agile teams in various industries with different Agile frameworks
- Provide real-time dashboards and reports that show the Agile team’s progress against the product roadmap

What We Will Cover In This Lesson


## Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile Part 1

So, why are forward-thinking organizations rapidly adopting Agile? And why are we seeing that global professional bodies such as The Project Management Institute (PMI) in their PMBOK Guide and The International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA)’s BABOK Guide, have incorporated and highlighted the importance of Agile in project management, business analysis, and other product delivery activities?

In an increasingly interconnected and competitive global marketplace, I am seeing Agile being leveraged by successful organizations across the globe to thrive in today’s digital age. Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value in a world where we are constantly being challenged with Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. Organizations that I have seen go through Agile transformation have benefited from the following:

- Faster time to market
- Early ROI
- Feedback from Real Customers

![Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile? Because of the challenges of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03d5b8_agndl1-why-agile/agndl1-why-agile.jpg)

Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity

_Note: You are going to learn more about VUCA later in this lesson._

## Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile Part 2

### Organizations that go through Agile transformation have also benefited from:

- Build the right products
- Early risk reduction
- Built-in quality
- Culture and morale

## Efficiency vs. Effectiveness

### Efficiency and effectiveness is a fine balancing act that Agile recommends.

If you’re only focused on going fast, you prioritize efficiency.

If you’re trying to focus on innovation, creativity, and making sure you’re working on the right thing, you need to focus on effectiveness.

This is often done at the cost of efficiency.

Agile ensures a balanced approach whereby Agile Teams ensure there is a balance between speed and creativity.

Agile transformations also benefit from:

- Customer Satisfaction
- Alignment
- Emergent Outcomes
- Predictability

Organizations want to use Agile to get there by developing products better, faster, and cheaper.

![Agile Balances Efficiency And. Effectiveness](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03d927_agnd-c1-l1-balancing-efficiency-and-effectiveness/agnd-c1-l1-balancing-efficiency-and-effectiveness.jpg)

# How Experts Approach Agile

## Thinking About Agile

### Agile Is Based on a Systems Thinking Approach and a Growth Mindset

- Agilists adopt a practical and realistic approach to delivering the best value, and quality, in the shortest sustainable time.
- A Systems Thinking approach, reinforced by a Growth Mindset, helps Agile experts deliver optimal business value.
- Systems thinking takes a holistic approach in which the Agile Team looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution.
- In a growth mindset, individuals on a team have the mindset that their abilities can grow through dedication and hard work.

![Systems Thinking + Growth Mindset = Optimal Business Value](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03d9a3_agnd-c1-experts/agnd-c1-experts.jpg)

Systems Thinking + Growth Mindset = Optimal Business Value

### Quiz Question

What delivers optimal business value in Agile teams?

Systems Thinking

Growth Mindset

Traditional Mindset

Submit

### New Terms

- **Growth Mindset**: The mindset that an individual's abilities can grow through dedication and hard work
- **Systems Thinking**: A holistic approach that looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution

    In this book, Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne share how one of the world's largest and most powerful companies leverages Agile practices to overcome today's challenges in the global marketplace.

# The Agile Mindset

## What Is the Agile Mindset?

### Agile permits teams to flourish in an environment that is increasingly Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous, also known as VUCA.

- Volatility is when there are unexpected or unstable possibilities that may influence the work being done
- Uncertainty refers to the extent to which an organization can confidently predict or forecast the future
- Complexity exists when there are many interconnected parts and variables that influence each other
- Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity, such as not having a clear understanding of the genuine needs of the customer and end-users

![Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity (VUCA)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03dbd2_agnd-c1-l1-vuca/agnd-c1-l1-vuca.jpg)

Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity (VUCA)

### Business Agility

Agile is a set of principles that guide how we as individuals, as teams and as organizations think about, as well as act upon, the work that we do.

Business agility is the ability of an organization to:

- Adapt quickly to market changes
- Respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense
- Adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality

### The Agile Mindset

When we talk about an Agile Mindset, we include:

- Respect
- Collaboration
- Continuous Improvement
- Iterative Learning Cycles
- Mastery and Ownership
- Focus on Delivering Value
- Adaptability to Change

![The Agile Mindset](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03dc0e_agnd-c1-l1-agile-mindset/agnd-c1-l1-agile-mindset.jpg)

The Agile Mindset

### Doing Agile vs. Being Agile

Some organizations and Agile Teams unfortunately just focus on Doing Agile. This equates to simply adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting agile principles and values.

Being Agile is the foundation that truly elevates individuals, teams, and organizations to unleash their latent potential to deliver monumental and focused value.

### New Terms

- **Agile Mindset**: The set of attitudes supporting an agile working environment
- **Being Agile**: When an Agile team lives & breathes Agile principles and values through Agile practices consistently every day
- **Business Agility**: The ability of an organization to adapt quickly to market changes, respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense, as well as adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality
- **Doing Agile**: When an Agile team adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting Agile principles and values

### Additional Resources

### Agile Mindset Anti-Patterns

Is the SocialKare.gov team operating with an Agile Mindset? Review the Case Study and your notes on the Agile Mindset. What Agile Mindset anti-patterns do you see at SocialKare.gov? Anti-patterns are practices that preventing the Agile mindset from being present and make things worse.

# Solution: The Agile Mindset

## My Solution

### The Anti-Patterns I Found:

- The Project Manager did not build an environment of making the team self-directed and self-organized. As a result, the team did not get an opportunity to build autonomy and confidence without relying on the Project Manager to step in to troubleshoot.
- Quality was not built-in iteratively in the product development life cycle. This resulted in delays in going to production, which frustrated both the business leadership and the end-users.
- Interim working solutions were not presented frequently to the business and end-users for proactive buy-in and feedback. This resulted in an incomplete set of features going to production.
- Excessive and not so valuable documentation was required by the project. As a result, the product results were disappointing.
- There was little in the way of ensuring these requirements made business sense throughout the project life cycle. As a result, the resource effort put into lower priority requirements ended up pushing out the higher priority needs.
# The Agile Manifesto

## What Is the Agile Manifesto?

Up until the late 1990s, a majority of product development followed a waterfall-style project development life cycle that was based on adhering to strict processes.

The whole product procedure was process-centric with the goal of delivering the product successfully rather than focusing on delivering a successful product. This is what lead 17 experts to get together and finalize the Agile Manifesto at a meeting in Utah back in 2001.

### The 4 Agile Core Values

These were developed by 17 industry experts and finalized in 2001. They are:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**: Agile places more importance and emphasis on people and their interactions over processes and even tools.
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: Documentation requires a time and resource commitment that might be wasteful.
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**: Agile promotes a collaborative outlook when product owners work with their customers in reaching an agreement on the details of the product delivery.
- **Responding to changes over following a plan**: Agile embraces the change that makes business sense.

![The Agile Manifesto's Four Paired Core Values](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03dd02_agnd-c1-l1-four-paired-core-values/agnd-c1-l1-four-paired-core-values.jpg)

Four Paired Core Values

## The Agile Manifesto Principles

The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set a solid foundation for the various Agile Frameworks that are currently being practiced by successful organizations in today’s digital age.

## The 12 Agile Principles

The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values drive the 12 Agile Principles. Let's look at the principles in detail.

1. **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software**. The goal of product development is the development of successful products.
2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage**. Due to the dynamic competitive landscape, requirements can and will change throughout product development.
3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale**. Frequent and iterative delivery of working products provides the business with practical feedback.
4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project**. The Product Owner and the Agile Team adopt practices that ensure inclusive and joint practices.
5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done**. Agile leaders build Agile teams with skilled resources who are willing to work together collaboratively with a growth mindset.
6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation**. For a product development team to succeed its members must communicate and collaborate effectively.
7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**. The primary measure of product development should be the delivery of working product increments, which meet the evolving needs of the business.
8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely**. A highly skilled team simply just cannot be expected to successfully develop a product by compelling people to work overtime for extended periods.
9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**. Built-in quality practices have enormous benefits. It allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the product.
10. **Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential**. With the guidance of the Product Owner, Agile Teams focus on high-value activities, which allows them to focus on the high business value needs.
11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**. This is a critical principle of the agile world to ensure that emerging and effective architectures, requirements, and designs are built into the product development life cycle to maximize technical excellence.
12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly**. Finding concrete opportunities for improvement is a continual effort.

The Agile Manifesto

### New Terms

- **Agile Manifesto**: The four paired Core Values and associated 12 Principles that set the foundation for all Agile Frameworks
- **Agile Principles**: Practical guidance for teams to adopt Agile
- **Four Paired Core Values**: The part of the Agile Manifesto that defines the values that establishes what Agile is for teams and organizations

# Solution: The Agile Manifesto

## My Solution

### The Missing Paired Core Values and Principles

At least two of the missing Paired Core Values from The Agile Manifesto at SocialKare.gov are:

- Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation

At least four of the missing Agile Principles at SocialKare.gov are:

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the competitive advantage.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
# Agile vs. Waterfall

## Comparing Agile to the Waterfall Methodology

### Waterfall vs. Agile

The waterfall model is a more stringent and process-driven style where the project is broken down into project activities through structured phases, with toll gates established to formally review progress. The focus is on the work to be done and not on delivering functional vertical slices.

Waterfall “fixes” the scope and estimates time & cost. Agile breaks this paradigm because Agile “fixes” time & cost and allows the scope to be flexible.

![Agile vs. Waterfall Triangle](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f03e15c_agnd-c1-agile-vs-waterfall/agnd-c1-agile-vs-waterfall.jpg)

Agile vs. Waterfall Triangle

||**Agile**|**Waterfall**|
|---|---|---|
|Product Lifecycle|Iterative|Distinct phases|
|Design Process|Incremental|Sequential|
|Change|Change is embraced|Change is a challenge|
|Mindset/Focus|Customer needs|Completing the project|
|Collaboration|Significant collaboration|Limited Synchronization|
|Requirements|Prepared incrementally|Prepared at start of project|
|Organization|Self-directed team|Led by Product Manager|

### The Stacey Diagram

The Stacey Diagram is a popular method to select the appropriate project or product management style.

![Stacey Diagram](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f33403d_agnd-c1-l1-stacey-diagram/agnd-c1-l1-stacey-diagram.jpg)

Stacey Diagram

#### Conditions Where Agile May Not Be Helpful:

- Lack of agreement in terms of requirements and process
- No vision and no clear roadmap
- Near certainty on requirements and process upfront

#### Conditions Where Agile Works Best:

- An environment of complexity and some uncertainty where an adaptive approach is needed
- With complicated requirements that need iterative cycles to understand the needs of end-users

### New Terms

- **Incremental Product Delivery**: An approach that utilizes a given number of steps, which go from start to finish following a linear path of progression
- **Iterative Product Delivery**: An approach where product development is broken into sequences of time-boxed, repeated cycles called iterations
- **Sequential Product Delivery**: A process where a defined sequence of steps must be followed as in the Waterfall approach
- **Stacey Diagram**: A diagram developed by Ralph Stacey to categorize the complexity of a project
- **Waterfall Methodology**: A methodology of product development that starts by breaking down project tasks into linear sequential phases or stages where each subsequent stage depends on the successful delivery of the previous ones

# Exercise: Agile vs. Waterfall

## Agile vs. Waterfall at SocialKare.gov

The SocialKare.gov team is taking a Waterfall approach to product development. Review the [SocialKare.gov Case Study(opens in a new tab)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/September/5f5f6bc7_agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study/agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study.pdf). Where do you see weaknesses in using a Waterfall approach rather than an Agile approach?

# Solution: Agile vs. Waterfall

## My Solution

### Waterfall at SocialKare.gov

At least two weaknesses of Waterfall Planning at SocialKare.gov are:

- Thorough documentation and paper trails
    - The team lost focus on working solutions, and time was taken away from valuable product development.
- The testing process started once development was over
    - Bugs were found later in development, where they are expensive to fix.
# Misconceptions of Agile

## Five Common Misconceptions of Agile

### Common Misconceptions of Agile

Here are 5 of the more common Agile misconceptions that should be avoided keeping the Agile Mindset in focus:

- **Scheduling Agile ceremonies makes a team Agile** - Holding ceremonies for the sake of holding ceremonies does not deliver benefits. Ceremonies must adhere to the core principles of Agile.
- **The Facilitator role is just like a traditional Project Manager** - The Facilitator role is different from the Project Manager role. A Facilitator should be a Servant Leader who assists with whatever the team needs to forward.
- **Large teams are okay** - Agile recommends small cross-functional teams that allow the team to be nimble and powerful.
- **The product backlog can be managed like a traditional requirements document** - The backlog should not be a process-driven document. It should focus on customer value and strategic objectives.
- **Documentation and audit trails for compliance are not important in Agile** - Agile does not mean no documentation -- it just removes low-value documents and documents what is valuable to maintain and sustain the product.

Keeping a customer-centric and product-focused thought process is essential.

# Exercise: Setting An Agile Mindset

## Setting An Agile Mindset at SocialKare.gov

With what you have learned about Agile, how can we help the SocialKare.gov team develop an Agile Mindset? Review the [SocialKare.gov Case Study (opens in a new tab)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/September/5f5f6bc7_agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study/agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study.pdf)and outline three recommended changes to the overall strategy for SocialKare.gov to set in place a more Agile Mindset. Take into account The Agile Manifesto in your recommendations and avoid the negative pitfalls of Waterfall.

# Solution: Setting An Agile Mindset

## My Solution

### Strategies to Bring an Agile Mindset to SocialKare.gov

The three strategies I recommend are:

- Ensuring management commitment. Any successful Agile transformation initiative requires a serious management commitment.
- Provide the team autonomy by empowering them. A de-centralized decision-making model is needed in Agile environments.
- Incorporate Adaptive Planning with relevant buy-in. Adaptive Planning includes a Product Vision, a Product Roadmap, a Release Plan, an Iteration Plan, as well as daily updates at the Daily Stand Up.
# Lesson Recap

## What We Have Learned

In this lesson, we covered some fundamental groundwork for developing our understanding of Agile. We learned that:

- Agile is a Mindset
- It is essential to _**be Agile**_ and not just _**do Agile**_
- The 4 Paired Core Values in the Agile Manifesto and their associated 12 Principles provide a solid foundation for successful Agile teams
- Agile is a very different approach than the traditional Waterfall methodology

Lesson Overview - Agile Teams

# Why Agile Teams?

## Why Do Agile Teams Matter?

![Benefits of Agile Teams - Focus on Value, Self-organized Teams, Constructive Conflict Resolution, Innovation Hub, Cultivate Mastery](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f208d1c_agnd-c1-l2-why-agile-teams/agnd-c1-l2-why-agile-teams.jpg)

Benefits of Agile Teams

### Agile Teams are a critical vehicle to deliver valuable results because of the following:

- **Focus on Value** - Agile is driven by the goal of delivering maximum business value that is aligned with the organization’s vision.
- **Self-Organized Teams** - Agile Teams have the autonomy to make some de-centralized decisions, which allows for shared ownership of the work.
- **Constructive Conflict Resolution** - Conflicts in Agile Teams are constructively resolved because the team is driven by a shared vision.
- **Innovation Hub** - Agile Teams, with diverse and cross-functional skill sets, are an innovation hub that spurs solutions.
- **Cultivate Mastery** - Time is put aside in Agile Teams for learning and growth. This allows Agile Team members to sharpen their skills.

### Quiz Question

### Quiz Question

Why must organizations move away from command-and-control behaviors and structures? (There is more than one correct answer)

Command-and-Control structures are ill-suited to today’s rapid digital world

Agile enables executives to step back and oversee work with a light but consistent touch

Agile guarantees cheaper delivery of results

Teams excel when they are directed to the best opportunities and armed with the best people

# How Experts Approach Agile Teams

## Thinking About Agile Teams

### Key Points About High Performing Teams

- Agilists believe that nothing is more critical to delivering exceptional products than teamwork.
    
- Agile Teams live and breathe the "we" mindset rather than “I."
    

![Teamwork is Agile's Secret Sauce](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f208dfe_agnd-c1-l2-secret-sauce/agnd-c1-l2-secret-sauce.jpg)

Teamwork is Agile's Secret Sauce

### Tuckman Model

The Tuckman Model, which has 5 stages of team development, describes how an Agile team progresses into an awesome Agile squad.

- **Forming** - Agile Team comes together and the Facilitator helps the team form by explaining the ground rules, product vision, and expected outcomes.
- **Storming** - This is where a team’s velocity is impacted because there tends to be some confusion and ambiguity around the work to be done, roles, and other product-related questions.
- **Norming** - Agile Team members develop a sense of trust and camaraderie. There’s a healthy rapport and each team member starts to look for the collective objectives of the team’s long-term success.
- **Performing** - Once an Agile Team has successfully worked together over a few iterations they should be in a state where they have gelled together and developed a strong cross-functional work style.
- **Adjourning** - If the business leaders realize that a product is not delivering value or is no longer needed in the market, the existing Agile Team members can be re-allocated to other more valuable work in the organization.

### New Terms

- **Adjourning**: The stage in the Tuckman Model where the Agile team’s goals have been completed, and the focus is on wrapping things up before team members get reassigned to other work
- **Forming**: The stage in the Tuckman Model when the team is getting accustomed to each other, ground rules are being established, and everyone is informed of the goals and objectives
- **Norming**: The stage in the Tuckman Model where a sense of trust develops among team members; interpersonal differences are taken care of now, and a sense of collaboration for the team's collective benefit arises
- **Performing**: The stage in the Tuckman Model where the team has matured into a well-established unit with a sharp focus on collaborative value delivery
- **Storming**: The stage in the Tuckman model where the team goes through a level of chaos in which there is confusion around the goals and objectives of the project, as well as confusion around roles and responsibilities

# Three Core Roles

## What Are the Three Core Roles?

### Three Core roles in Agile Frameworks: Product Owner, Facilitator, and Agile Team

- A **Product Owner**, often referred to as PO in short, is responsible for working with both The Agile Team as well as the business to maximize the value of the product deliverables being worked on. The Product Owner is primarily responsible for prioritizing and managing the Product Backlog, or the prioritized work item list.
- **Agile Teams** are self-directed and self-organized. The Agile Team members are the ones who accomplish the actual work of completing and delivering a potentially shippable version of the product at the end of each Iteration.

![Three Core Roles in Agile: Product Owner, Facilitator, Team](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f209074_agnd-c1-l2-three-core-roles/agnd-c1-l2-three-core-roles.jpg)

Three Core Roles in Agile

### Agile Team Members Exhibit T-Shaped Skills

When Agile Team members exhibit T-Shaped skills:

- They have tremendous expertise in at least one area.
- They are also capable of providing value in other areas outside their expertise.
- Team members are able to do role blending by going beyond their core vertical skill set.

![Agile Team Members Exhibit T-Shaped Skills](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f344e06_agnd-c1-l2-tshaped-skills/agnd-c1-l2-tshaped-skills.jpg)

## Facilitator As Servant Leader

### To Serve and Support

The Facilitator is responsible for ensuring the Agile Team moves along at an acceptable pace. The Facilitator is also usually an Agile Coach who promotes Agile practices and values.

### Facilitators are Servant Leaders Who Serve and Support

Servant Leadership adopts a leadership viewpoint in which the leader positions himself or herself to serve and support. Servant Leadership includes:

- Active listening
- Respect
- Positive attitude
- Neutralize personal biases

![Characteristics of Servant Leadership in Agile - Active listening, Respect, Positive attitude, Neutralize personal biases, Trust Agile Team’s competencies, Raise relevant questions, and Shares power and control](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f450c84_agnd-c1-l2-servant-leadership/agnd-c1-l2-servant-leadership.jpg)

Characteristics of Servant Leadership

### Servant Leadership Helps the Team Deliver Results

Servant Leadership also includes:

- Trust Agile Team’s competencies
- Raise relevant questions
- Shares power and control

Servant Leadership helps a Facilitator build a high-performing Agile team, which in turn enables the Facilitator to truly help the Agile Team achieve results that positively deliver business value.

### New Terms

- **Facilitator**: The person who ensures that the Agile Team moves along at an acceptable pace towards the business objective and removes any blockages or impediments that may be slowing the team
- **Self-Directed**: Team members are empowered to decide among themselves who does what and how it is to be accomplished in a collaborative manner
- **T-Shaped Skills**: A strong vertical skill combined with the capability and willingness to step into other cross-functional needs
- **Team Member**: The people who accomplish the actual work of completing and delivering a potentially shippable version of the product at the end of each iteration

- **Agile Team Member** - Primarily includes developers who are responsible for the creation and delivery of a system; However, all other Agile team members will also be included in this category. This includes, but is not limited to, those who will conduct modeling, programming, testing, business analysis, front-end design, release activities, and others. The recommended employee is _**Tim Devs**_.
# High Performing Agile Teams

## What Is a High Performing Agile Team?

### High Performing Agile Teams have the following in common.

They are:

- Independent and self-directed
- Small, T-shaped teams
- Focused on the mission
- Supported by executives

Moreover, Agile Teams make decisions on their own. They also develop team norms and ground rules, which are useful for guiding group behavior towards a common purpose.

Attributes of High Performing Agile Teams

## Building High Performing Agile Teams

### Building a High Performing Agile Team

Let’s look at how we can build a high performing Agile Team:

- Inspire the Agile Team.
- Build a Cross-functional Diverse Team.
- Maintain Focus as Team Evolves.
- Encourage Innovation and Free Thinking.
- Communicate Clearly.
- Work Collaboratively to Solve Problems.
- Timebox Meetings.
- Recognize and Appreciate.
- Include Uncommitted Objectives.
- Take Time Out to Connect and Have Fun.

### High Performing Agile Teams Never Disappoint

According to the American author Dan Pink, a high performing team is given purpose, an opportunity to develop mastery, as well as autonomy in decisions. Such a high-performing Agile Team never disappoints. Such Agile Teams deliver phenomenal results consistently, regardless of the challenges they encounter. Senior leaders in an organization can turbocharge an Agile Team by enabling them to be self-directed and independent.

High Performing Agile Teams Never Disappoint

## Remote Agile Teams

In an increasingly interconnected global business landscape, High Performing Agile Teams have to identify issues and benefits related to organizing and managing remote Agile Teams. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has genuinely changed the landscape with remote Agile Teams being accepted as a valuable norm.

### Implementing Remote Agile Teams

Working with a remote Agile team successfully requires attention to the following:

- Team communication.
- Time Zone Differences.
- Work From Home Best Practices.
- Catch-Ups.
- Lack of Team Cohesion.

Remote Agile teams are definitely here to stay for the foreseeable future. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sea change in terms of the acceptance of the value of remote teams.

![Remote Agile Teams Are Here to Stay!](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f209a2f_agnd-c1-l2-remote-agile-teams/agnd-c1-l2-remote-agile-teams.jpg)

# Solution: High Performing Agile Teams

## My Solution

### My Solution

- John Details, as a Facilitator, should Focus on facilitation and not technical solutions; John needs to let the SocialKare.gov team be self-organized and self-directed.
- Sarah Tenure, the Product Owner, should Listen to the Agile Team for their input on priorities. Sarah should not interfere in the Agile Team’s technical decisions at SocialKare.gov.
- Tims Devs, an Agile Team member, should allow developers on the team to develop cross-functional skills, as well as work to collaborate with the business more proactively.
# Organizing an Optimal Agile Team and Non-Core Roles

## What Are Size, Structure, and Cross-functional Skills in an Agile Team?

### Optimal Agile Team has Between 5-12 Members

- An Agile Team size of less than 5 would make it difficult to have all the competencies needed to do all the work within this one team since an Agile Team should be a cross-functional and multi-disciplinary unit tackling a common goal.
- An Agile Team larger than 12 skilled resources will make it difficult to self-direct and self-organize. As the number of team members increases, the number of communication channels also increases.

### Clarity and Respect for Core Roles is Critical

Role clarity is an important prerequisite.

Agilists have to remind Agile organizations of the core roles and their responsibilities:

- Product Owner- Voice of the Customer(VOC) and Product Champion
- Facilitator- A Servant Leader
- Agile Team- Responsible for determining how to get the work done that the PO has prioritized

Cross-functional Agile teams are best run as small self-directed teams of 5-12 skilled resources.

![More Communication Channels = More Noise](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/July/5f209afa_agnd-c1-l2-more-channels-means-more-noise/agnd-c1-l2-more-channels-means-more-noise.jpg)

More Communication Channels = More Noise

## Non-Core Roles

While Non-Core Roles are not defined as mandatory in all Agile Frameworks, they can play a key role in the success of Agile Product Delivery.

- **Stakeholders** - Stakeholders can include Customers, Users, Sponsors, and others who have an interest in the product being worked on, but are not involved in the day-to-day development of the solution results.
    
- **Vendors and Strategic Suppliers** - Vendors and Strategic Partners provide products and services that are usually not within the core competencies of the organization or Agile Team.
    
- **Center of Excellence (CoE)** - Many organizations have a Center of Excellence focused on either Project or Product Delivery. A CoE often provides guidance on Governance and Reporting requirements to executives and regulators.
    
- **Enterprise Architect** - Reviews technical solutions to ensure they align with the overall organization's architecture.
    
- **Domain Subject Matter Expert** - Provides valuable support to the PO and Business Analyst on domain knowledge.
    

A successful Agile Team is typically both influenced and supported by several key Non-Core Roles.

### Coaching Models

#### Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

The Dreyfus model presents a simple-to-understand framework for measuring an individual’s progress in any skill they are looking to acquire and gain expertise in. The five developmental stages identified in the Dreyfus Model for Skill Development are:

1. Novice
2. Advanced Beginner
3. Competent
4. Proficient
5. Expert

#### Shu Ha Ri

Shu Ha Ri has its origins in Japanese Martial Arts. It is presented by experts as a way of thinking when learning a new skill. Alistair Cockburn is credited with introducing it in the Agile world when it comes to acquiring Agile skills for product development. There are three stages in Shu Ha Ri’s knowledge acquisition model:

- **Shu**: Here the Agile team member mimics and follows the teachings of an expert.
- **Ha**: At the Ha stage, team members start to experiment and begin to dig deeper into the theory that is driving the expert’s teachings
- **Ri**: When someone reaches the Ri stage, they have directly experimented and experienced how teaching is beneficial to the Agile team’s maturity. This allows them to get creative and adapt to their unique circumstances and organizational context.

- [Becoming agile with ShuHaRi(opens in a new tab)](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/becoming-agile-with-shuhari-9649)

### New Terms

- **Center of Excellence (COE)**: A unit comprised of seasoned experts in the organization that provide the Agile team support, best practices, guidance, and perhaps even training on Agile practices
- **Enterprise Architect (EA)**: A team member who ensures IT and the business units are aligned
# Exercise: Non-Core Roles On An Agile Team

### Identifying Non-Core Roles at SocialKare.gov

Agile Teams have non-core roles too! Review the [SocialKare.gov Case Study(opens in a new tab)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/September/5f5f6bc7_agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study/agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study.pdf) and identify some of the non-core roles that make sense for the SocialKare.gov team. Explain why those roles are necessary for the SocialKare.gov team.

![Screenshot of SocialKare.gov logo](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f31ceb8_socialkare.gov-logo/socialkare.gov-logo.jpg)

# Solution: Non-Core Roles On An Agile Team

## My Solution

### Recommend Three Non-Core Roles

- **Sponsor** - Senior sponsorship is critical to the success of any Agile product delivery.
    
- **Enterprise Architect** - An Enterprise Architect will be a valuable resource for the technical team members to seek guidance on to ensure whatever they develop is in alignment with SocialKare.gov's enterprise-wide architecture model.
    
- **Domain Subject Matter Expertise** - This individual can be very beneficial for the Product Owner, as well as Business Analyst. This person can be called upon as needed to provide Domain knowledge and advice.

# Agile Governance

## What Is Agile Governance?

### Effective Agile Governance is about Making Decisions

In order to enable effective Agile governance, the following needs to be kept in mind:

- Tolerances Are Essential For Agile Governance.
- Decentralized Decision Making Empowers The Team.
- Agile Governance Delivers Goodwill and Trust.
- Agile Promotes Light and Simple Governance.
- Strategic and Long-Term Decisions Remain Centralized.

Effective Agile governance ensures decisions are made in a simpler and lighter manner per the Agile Manifesto’s guidance to keep things simple.

### Additional Resources

- [Organizing: Centralization and Decentralization(opens in a new tab)](https://www.toppr.com/guides/business-management-and-entrepreneurship/organizing/centralization-and-decentralization/) - This article compares the advantages of centralized and decentralized organization and describes the factors for determining the degree of decentralization decision-making

# Exercise: Centralized vs Decentralized Decisions

## Applying Agile Governance at SocialKare.gov

As we learned, while decentralized decision-making is encouraged in Agile, some decisions need to remain centralized. Review the [SocialKare.gov Case Study(opens in a new tab)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/September/5f5f6bc7_agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study/agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study.pdf) and identify the types of decisions that need to be made. What are the characteristics of decisions that can be decentralized? And what are the characteristics of decisions that should be centralized?

# Solution: Centralized vs. Decentralized Decisions

## My Solution

### Agile Governance Body Model

The exercise asked you to identify three decisions that should be centralized and three that should be decentralized at SocialKare.gov.

### Centralized Decisions

- Decisions that are unlikely to alter in the short term at SocialKare.gov; examples could include a significant technology platform selection or organizational structure alignment.
- Decisions that deliver large and organization-wide economic benefits at SocialKare.gov; examples here could include standard tools for managing the product life cycle or project life cycle, as well as decisions related to which vendor partner to set up an offshore relationship with.
- Decisions which SocialKare.gov’s leadership needs to make for rare decisions; examples of centralized decisions here include long-term product strategy, international expansion options and even decommissioning a product that has been in the market for a long time.

### Decentralized Decisions

- Decisions that address frequent and common questions that arise at SocialKare.gov, such as Product Backlog prioritization.
- Time-sensitive decisions, which should not be delayed because such delays will have a significant cost of delay for SocialKare.gov.
- Decisions that need specific local or team level context, such as self-organization of individuals to a new challenge that is emerging.

# What Kills High Performing Teams

## Pitfalls That High Performing Teams Should Avoid

### What Kills High-Performance Teams?

- **Pitfall #1**: Conflicts are not managed effectively; it is important to regularly remind the Agile Team of the value of respectfully discussing differing opinions and suggestions.
- **Pitfall #2**: Blame game begins; there needs to be a tolerance for some failures since Agile Teams work in fast-paced situations. Such blame games and negative criticism quickly escalate to unhealthy conflict. The smarter and healthier outlook is to continue to keep the Agile Team on a learning mindset.
- **Pitfall#3**: Rules of Engagement are not followed; the Facilitator must ensure the Agile Team honors the agreed-upon rules of engagement and that team communications are frequent and relevant to avoid a high performing Agile Team from commencing its decline.
- **Pitfall #4**: Spark or passion is dimmed; if the Agile Team starts to perceive that their work is not as valuable, it can annihilate motivation. When the product vision starts to get foggy, the Product Owner needs to quickly step in to clarify.

### Quiz Question

What kills the momentum of a high performing Agile team?

Any conflict

Discussing opportunities for improvement

Following rules of engagement

When the Agile team does not have a view of the product vision

Submit

### New Terms

- **Blame Game**: Circumstances in an Agile team where team members try to blame each other for issues and challenges rather than working together to collaboratively resolve what they are encountering

# Case Study

## Case Study

Now that you've learned the roles and responsibilities of various roles on an Agile team, in the video below, Chirag Doshi, a Principle Consultant at ThoughtWorks, tells his personal anecdote on how he built an Agile team as a Tech Lead.

Mature Agile teams frequently **blur role boundaries within the team**. This flexibility results in higher levels of collaboration and co-creation and helps teams optimize for their overall team goals. It also creates a T-shaped profile for the team members.

The key takeaway from this case study is that if you are on an Agile team, consider blurring role boundaries. Don't feel boxed by your role. Collaborate and share responsibilities with people in other roles on the team. This increases team efficiency and improves the quality of the software you build. It also helps you gain a deeper understanding of software development and expands your ways of thinking.


# Lesson Recap

## What We Have Learned

### Lesson Recap

In this lesson, we talked about:

- The characteristics of high performing Agile Teams.
- We then proceeded to talk about the size, structure, and skills of a High Performing Team. We discussed how Agile frameworks recommend a team size of between 5-12 skilled resources that are self-organizing and cross-functional with T-shaped skills.
- We then looked at Agile governance and how, based on the Agile Manifesto’s guidelines, Agile recommends a lightweight and simple approach to governance. Where possible, decentralized decision-making is encouraged.
- We finished up by talking about some pitfalls in which High Performing Agile Teams disintegrate and how to avoid those situations.

This lesson emphasizes how High Performing Agile Teams help organizations survive in such turbulent times. As the pace of change increases and the world of work makes ever greater demands on teams, high performing Agile Teams will become increasingly important.

In the next lesson, we will look at Agile Frameworks.

# Why Agile Frameworks?

## Why Do Agile Frameworks Matter?

### Agile Frameworks Are A Vehicle for Practically Utilizing Agile

Agile's principles related to simplicity, adaptability, and the ability to embrace change attract attention. For Agile to practically be utilized effectively, an Agile Framework, or a combination of frameworks, is usually adopted.

### Similarities Between Agile Frameworks:

- Adhere to the Agile Mindset as being fundamental to the success of any Agile journey
- Emphasize that being Agile is critical to successfully doing Agile
- The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set the foundation for all Agile Frameworks
- Provide guidance on how to bring the Agile Manifesto’s core values and principles to life

### Quiz Question

# How Experts Approach Agile Frameworks

## Thinking About Agile Frameworks

### Agile Frameworks are Enablers that Bring to Fruition the Value of Agile

This includes:

- Focusing more on the individuals and interactions; ultimate determining factor for the success of a product are the resources on the Agile product delivery team.
- Do not force Agile unnecessarily; Teams that are already performing well can be gradually introduced to additional Agile practices based on a specific Agile Framework.
- Refined user stories are important; Agilists work with Product Owners to ensure the user stories have been sufficiently refined for the Agile Team to proceed.
- Respect the backlog; Agilists focus on ensuring the Agile Team does not over-commit to what can be accomplished in each iteration, especially during the first few iterations.

### Implementing a Specific Agile Framework is a Fine Balancing Act

- Must adapt based on each organization’s unique culture and context.
- Experts have to regularly remind both leaders and the Agile Team to remember that there is no one way to execute Agile practices in an organization.
- Agile principles and practices are by their very nature to be adapted as needed.

![Framework “Balanced” with Organizational Context](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f3201c9_agnd-c1-l3-balanced-framework-and-context/agnd-c1-l3-balanced-framework-and-context.jpg)

# Agile Frameworks

## What Are Agile Frameworks?

### Agile is an Umbrella Term for a Variety of Frameworks that Align with The Agile Manifesto

Every Agile team's goal is to deliver value-driven functionality with built-in quality and to do it quickly. This is where **Fail Fast and Learn** is priceless. Agile teams who wish to deliver both amazing product features that delight customers, as well as do it fast, must learn to quickly change course when it is realized that a product feature is heading down the wrong path.

### The Agile Umbrella

The Agile Umbrella has some key characteristics:

- **Deliver Value**: An absolutely key driver behind anything Agile is to deliver value.
- **Continual Improvement**: Agile promotes incremental improvement to minimize resistance from all who are involved.
- **Flexibility**: Flexibility is one of the foundations of any Agile Framework.
- **Trust and Respect**: Agile Frameworks promote trust and respect because such trust and respect motivate Agile teams.
- **Cultivate Mastery**: This built-in structure for Agile team members to hone their skills further motivates the Agile team.

# Scrum

## What Is Scrum?

### Scrum Framework

Scrum is by far the most common Agile Framework.

- The features are delivered in iterations known as Sprints.
- The Team conducts Daily Stand-Ups in which they provide updates to each other.
- Retrospectives are conducted to identify opportunities for improvement at the end of each Sprint.
- Specific roles, as well as certain Ceremonies, are recommended in the Scrum Framework.

### Scrum Pillars

- **Transparency** - Transparency builds trust and openness both within the Agile Team, as well as with those stakeholders outside the Agile Team.
- **Inspection** - Inspection involves the business users reviewing the Agile Team’s progress towards the defined goals.
- **Adaptation** - Agile Teams adjust and adapt based on opportunities for improvement that are identified either by the Agile Team themselves or through feedback from others outside the team.

Scrum Pillars: Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation

## Scrum Values

### 5 Scrum Values

- **Focus** - Everyone in the Team focuses on the work to be completed in order to deliver the Sprint goals.
- **Courage** - Members of the Team need to have the courage to do what is right to ensure the Sprint goals are met.
- **Openness** - The Team and its stakeholders agree to a culture of openness.
- **Commitment** - Commitments build trust within the Agile Team members, as well as with the business users and leaders.
- **Respect** - Respect is a key in Scrum for a high-achieving Agile Team.

### When Scrum Does Not Make Sense

As shown in the Stacey diagram, an Agile Framework like Scrum works best with complex and complicated projects and products. There may not be much value in utilizing Agile principles

- when there is a near certainty in both the requirements and process upfront.
- when there is chaos. Scrum cannot bring value to an environment where there is no vision or clear roadmap.
- when the project is simple and predictable and the need for iterative learning and adapting is of no value.

- Ceremonies to be conducted
- Schedule and duration of the ceremonies, as well as their purpose and agenda


# Solution: Setting Up Scrum

## My Solution

## Set up the Scrum Framework

You were asked to cover the Core roles, as well as Ceremonies and their details.

### Core Roles in Scrum

- Scrum Master: Servant Leader to the PO and Team.
- Product Owner: PO represents the SocialKare.gov stakeholders and is known as The Voice of the Customer (VOC).
- Agile Team Member: Responsible for the creation and delivery of product solutions.

### Scrum Ceremonies

- Retrospective: An opportunity for the Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements; time-boxed to 3 hours once per Sprint.
- Project Vision: Business leaders articulate the business need that is intended to be achieved; time-boxed to 1 hour and occurs once per project.
- Release Planning: A Release Plan is defined as to when various sets of usable functionality or products will be delivered to the customer; time-boxed to 20 minutes per Release.
- Sprint Planning: Work to be performed in the Sprint is planned; can occur a few times per Sprint; time-boxed to a total of 8 hours per Sprint.
- Daily Stand-Ups: The team synchronizes activities and creates a plan for the next 24 hours; Each team member answers 3 questions: What did I do since the last time we met? What do I plan to accomplish today? What impediments am I encountering?; held daily (preferably in the morning); time-boxed to 15 minutes.
- Sprint Review and Demo: Along with Demo, the Team discusses marketplace changes and backlog with PO; the Team presents completed Sprint deliverables to Product Owner; time-boxed to 4 hours once per Sprint.


# Kanban

## What is Kanban?

### Kanban Framework

Kanban has its origins in lean product development, an approach to product development inspired by lean manufacturing principles and practices at Toyota.

### Lean Principles

Lean product development focuses on 7 fundamental principles:

- **Eliminate Waste** - Anything that does not add value to the customer.
- **Build in Quality** - Lean focuses on good practices to ensure integrity and prevent defects.
- **Create Knowledge** - Lean encourages both training and peer-to-peer knowledge transfer.
- **Defer Commitment** - Lean recommends the Agile Team wait until the "last responsible moment" to make a decision, which allows for additional time to innovate.
- **Deliver Fast** - Lean encourages the Agile Team to create and deliver the product incrementally.
- **Respect People** - The Team must feel trusted and valuable to think and solve problems for themselves.
- **Optimize the Whole** - Lean encourages decreasing barriers to increase efficiencies by decreasing the amount of hand-offs and reducing WIP.

Lean Principles set the foundation for Kanban.

![Lean Principles](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f320cee_agnd-c1-l3-lean-principles/agnd-c1-l3-lean-principles.jpg)

Lean Principles

## Five Principles of Kanban

Kanban is a lightweight Agile Framework with 5 principles:

- **Visualize the Flow** - The Team visualizes the workflow, which helps in organizing, tracking, and optimizing the work.  
    
- **Limit Work in Progress**- Limiting WIP helps to smooth the flow of work, reduce lead times, improve quality and delivery more frequently.  
    
- **Manage Flow** - By Monitoring and measuring the flow of work, issues are identified as soon as possible, which improves delivery predictability.  
    
- **Make Policies Explicit** - Establishing policies provides the Agile Team with explicit understanding of the processes for discussions around issues.  
    
- **Improve Collaboratively** - The Agile Team must own the team’s work related processes and work collaboratively to improve the processes being utilized.

![The Five Kanban Principles: Visualize the Flow, Limit WIP, Manage Flow, Make Policies Explicit, Improve Collaboratively](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f36dc77_agnd-c1-l3-kanban-principles/agnd-c1-l3-kanban-principles.jpg)

Five Principles of Kanban

A Kanban Board plays a valuable role as an information radiator since it shows the work items in their various stages of the product development journey.

![Screenshot of a Kanban Board listing tasks in Backlog, In Progress, and Done categories](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f36d7ec_kanbanboard/kanbanboard.jpg)

Kanban Board

## Kanban Ceremonies, Core Roles and Artifacts

### Kanban Ceremonies

You will recall the 6 Scrum Ceremonies. In Kanban:

- The Ceremonies are simplified.
- There is no Sprint Planning Ceremony.
- And there is no Sprint Retrospective.
- Sprint Review/Demo is just called Review Demo.

So, the 4 Kanban ceremonies align with 4 of the Scrum ceremonies.

![Kanban Ceremonies: Project Vision, Daily Stand Up, Review/Demo, Release Planning](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f320e6d_agnd-c1.-l3-kanban-ceremonies/agnd-c1.-l3-kanban-ceremonies.jpg)

Kanban Ceremonies

### Where Does Kanban Make Sense?

- Since it focuses on the Agile Team’s workflow and throughput, Kanban is seen as a better Agile Framework option solution for projects where the work is likely to involve a large quantity of relatively small activities.
- Kanban is also suitable for work that may arise on an ad-hoc basis.

### Kanban Roles and Artifacts

### Core Roles in Kanban

- **Product Owner** - Seen as the voice of the customer.
- **Facilitator** - Team's Servant Leader.
- **Agile Team** - These are the resources that collaborate and work on the product deliverables.

### Kanban Artifacts

- **Kanban Board** - A Kanban Board plays a valuable role since it articulates the work items in their various stages of the product development journey.
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram** - A Cumulative Flow Diagram shows the total amount of WIP and how quickly projects are being completed.

![Kanban Roles (Product Owner, Facilitator, and the Agile Team) and Artifacts (Kanban Board and Cumulative Flow Diagram)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f320eb4_agnd-c1-l3-kanban-roles-and-artifacts/agnd-c1-l3-kanban-roles-and-artifacts.jpg)

# XP

## XP Values

### XP Framework

Extreme Programming, also known as XP, is a powerful Agile Framework with its roots in software development. XP has a strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.

### XP Values

There are 5 XP Core Values. They are

- **Simplicity** - XP encourages reducing unnecessary complexity when building a solution to avoid waste.
- **Communication** - All team members have transparency in being aware of what is expected of them in terms of deliverables, as well as being aware of what others in the team are contributing towards.
- **Feedback** - Feedback in every iteration is taken seriously in XP. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate working results early and often.
- **Courage** - Courage allows a team to bravely tell the truth about progress, estimates, and any impediments to value delivery. It also gives the necessary fuel to adopt technical best practices.
- **Respect** - Respect is a key, foundational element in XP for a high-achieving Team.

![XP Values: Simplicity, Communication, Feedback, Courage and Respect](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f321167_agnd-c1-l3-xp-values/agnd-c1-l3-xp-values.jpg)

XP Values

## XP Practices

### XP Practices

The 5 XP core values discussed earlier set the tone for XP’s 13 core practices.

### 13 Core Practices

- **Whole Team** - The Whole Team practice encourages the entire XP team to be collocated when practically possible. Collaboration tools can be leveraged to follow the Whole Team practice for Remote Teams.
- **Planning Games** - XP encourages creative approaches to planning. The two formal planning ceremonies in XP are Release Planning and Iteration Planning.
- **Small Releases** - Small and frequent releases are encouraged in XP at both the iteration, as well as release level.
- **Customer Tests** - In the Customer Tests practice, the PO works with the customer to describe one or more test criteria as part of defining the requested functionality. The team then ideally builds automated tests to confirm that the developed product’s acceptance criteria are met.
- **Collective Code Ownership** - No single developer owns a piece of work. This strengthens the product with a broader knowledge of the code across the team.
- **Code Standards** - Everyone in the team codes to a consistent standard in XP.
- **Sustainable Pace** - A consistently high level of productivity can only be maintained at a sustainable pace.
- **Metaphor** - It is important to adhere to a set of easy-to-remember standard naming conventions for items such as variable names, class names, and methods to facilitate communication.
- **Continuous Integration** - Software builds are regularly integrated by combining all the coding components together to verify that it compiles and works as a collective codebase.
- **Test-Driven Development** - In TDD, the team writes the acceptance test before the actual coding is done.
- **Refactoring** - The Team works to improve existing code to keep the design cleaner to maintain and develop new functionality on top of the existing codebase.
- **Simple Design** - The optimal design is the simplest one that works.
- **Pair Programming** - XP advises team members to work on product deliverables in pairs; data shows that this produces higher quality code and costs less in the long run.

The XP Framework has a more stringent approach than many other Agile Frameworks. For example, Kanban is a lighter framework with room for flexibility.

![13 XP Core Practices - Whole Team, Planning Games, Small Releases, Customer Tests, Collective Code Ownership, Code Standards, Sustainable Pace, Metaphor, Continuous Integration, Test-Driven Development, Refactoring, Simple Design, Pair Programming](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f3211d9_agnd-c1-l3-xp-practices/agnd-c1-l3-xp-practices.jpg)

XP Practices

## XP Core Role and Ceremonies

### XP Roles

XP has a much more stringent approach than many other Agile Frameworks. None of the practices are optional, and it is strongly oriented to software development.

The XP Framework has 4 core roles, 3 of which are quite analogous to the 3 core roles in most Agile Frameworks:

- **Customer** - Somewhat like the PO; the customer is the business representative.
- **Tester** - Primarily responsible for quality assurance.
- **Coach** - Acts as a mentor for the team; also a Facilitator for the team.
- **Programmers** - Developers who build the product.

![XP Core Roles: Customer, Testers, Coach and Programmers](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f321338_agnd-c1-l3-xp-core-roles/agnd-c1-l3-xp-core-roles.jpg)

XP Core Roles

### XP Ceremonies and Artifacts

All XP ceremonies align with the Scrum Framework ceremonies discussed earlier. The names are a little different for some of the ceremonies.

### XP Ceremony Names

- Iteration Planning
- Iteration Review
- Iteration Retrospective
- Project Vision
- Daily Stand Up
- Release Planning

### XP Artifacts

Since XP is a more thorough Agile Framework in terms of processes, all the artifacts covered in the Scrum Framework and Kanban Framework are included in XP.

- Product Increment
- Product Backlog
- Iteration Backlog
- Burndown Chart
- Burnup Chart
- Velocity Chart
- Cumulative Flow Diagram

![XP Ceremonies are the same ceremonies as the ones in the Kanban framework](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/August/5f32137c_agnd-c1-l3-xp-ceremonies/agnd-c1-l3-xp-ceremonies.jpg)

XP Ceremonies

### New Terms

- **Continuous Integration**: A process that combines all of the coding components of a software build to verify that it compiles and works as a collective codebase
- **Iteration Backlog**: A list of clearly defined user stories, which the Agile team has committed to delivering in the iteration
- **Metaphor**: A set of easy-to-remember standard naming conventions used in XP to facilitate communication
- **Planning Games**: Another name for planning in XP, including release planning and iteration planning
- **Test-Driven Development**: A process where each small release is thoroughly tested prior to being released to production
- **XP (Extreme Programming)**: An Agile Framework with a strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development
- **XP Practices**: The core practices in XP, which are Whole Team, Planning Games, Small Releases, Customer Tests, Continuous Integration, Metaphor, Sustainable Pace, Code Standards, Collective Code Ownership, Test-Driven Development, Refactoring, Simple Design, and Pair Programming

# Exercise: Kanban vs. XP

## How is Kanban Different From XP

Review what you know about the Kanban and XP Frameworks. Where are they different? Where are they similar?


# Solution: Kanban vs. XP

## My Solution

### Key Differences Between XP and Kanban

In this exercise, you were asked to identify key differences between Kanban and XP.

### Core Roles

- **Kanban Core Roles**:
    - PO
    - Facilitator
    - Agile Team
- **XP Core Roles**:
    - Customer, which is somewhat like the PO in Kanban.
    - Tester, which does not explicitly exist as a separate role in Kanban.
    - Coach, who is somewhat similar to the Facilitator role in Kanban.
    - Programmers, which is most closely related to the Agile Team role in Kanban.

### Ceremonies

XP has two ceremonies, which do not need to take place in Kanban.

- **Iteration Retrospective**, where there’s an opportunity for the Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements.
- **Iteration Planning**, where the work to be performed in the iteration is planned.

XP is more stringent. XP has 13 detailed practices whereas Kanban just focuses on flow and WIP.

# Challenges With XP

Submit

## XP Doesn't Work For Every Team

### Challenges with XP

While many organizations get excited when they read that XP brings in rigor alongside the typical benefits of Agile, Agile teams often encounter challenges with XP:

- **XP is software-centric** - XP places emphasis on software development practices, unlike many other Agile Frameworks in which the emphasis is more on streamlining processes.
- **XP Coaches are Tough to Recruit** - Recruiting experienced XP coaches is a challenge. XP coaches are expected to be familiar with software development, as well as have the right personality and temperament to facilitate ceremonies and difficult conversations.
- **XP is Complex** - XP is complex to implement and often feels anti-Agile to some organizations and their leaders. With 13 defined practices, XP has considerably more practices than many other Agile Frameworks.

Organizations who are thinking of XP need experienced XP Coaches, a willing and highly skilled team of programmers, and leaders who have the resilience to guide the organization through the initial transformation.

# Exercise: Recommend a Framework

## Which Framework Would You Recommend for SocialKare.gov?

The executives have realized that you bring tremendous Agile experience to the organization So, rather than suggesting an Agile Framework themselves, they have asked you to recommend an Agile Framework that will work best for SocialKare.gov.

Review the [SocialKare.gov case study(opens in a new tab)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/September/5f5f6bc7_agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study/agnd-c1-foundations-of-agile-socialkare.gov-case-study.pdf) and the Scrum, Kanban, and XP frameworks. Recommend a framework for SocialKare.gov. You are allowed to recommend either one framework or a combination of frameworks.

Justify your answer with at least 3 key characteristics of this project that will work better with the Agile Framework you are recommending.

# Solution: Recommend a Framework

## My Solution

### Recommend an Agile Framework for SocialKare.gov

In this exercise, you were asked to recommend a particular Agile Framework for SocialKare.gov, taking into account their specific context.

I recommend SocialKare.gov to adopt the Scrum Framework.

- There is a need for time-boxed Iterations/Sprints - Time-boxed Sprints will allow for regular demos and proactive feedback from the business to ensure the project is heading in the right direction.
- Retrospectives will help - Sprint Retrospectives will ensure the Agile team is working towards guided continual improvement.
- SocialKare.gov has a need for self-directed and self-organized teams - The Scrum Framework insists on the Agile team being given autonomy to work on the prioritized and assigned Features and Functionality.

I do not recommend Kanban or XP.

- Kanban is too lightweight for SocialKare.gov since it does not provide sufficient rigor to manage such a complex project.
- XP is not recommended for SocialKare.gov. XP is too software-centric and heavy for SocialKare.gov.
# Lesson Recap

## What We Have Learned

### Lesson Recap

In this lesson:

- We talked about the value of Agile Frameworks. We discussed how an Agile Framework takes the abstract principles of the Agile Manifesto and gives it a practical shape.
- We then looked at the important characteristics of the Scrum Framework, which is by far the most common Agile Framework in use across various industries globally. We saw how the Scrum 3 principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation help Agile Teams creatively manage the work with a focus on delivering complex adaptive product features in an age when customers expect rapid responses based on emerging market demands.
- We proceeded to examine the important characteristics of the Kanban Framework with its origins in lean product development. Kanban is a lightweight Agile Framework with considerable flexibility.
- The final Agile Framework we looked at was XP, a powerful Agile Framework with its roots in software development. We discussed XP’s stringent and strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.
- We finished up by talking about some of the challenges of adopting the XP Framework.

I hope you saw how an Agile Framework allows an organization to execute on Agile’s lofty promise.

# Course Recap

### Course Recap

Let’s do a quick course recap.

In the first lesson:

- We first learned that Agile is a Mindset. It is essential to be Agile and not just do the mechanics of what Agile recommends.
- We then went on to cover the Agile Manifesto. We talked about how the need for Agile grew organically as a result of experts realizing that there was a gap in customer value delivery in many projects that followed the traditional waterfall or process-centric structures. We discussed the importance of the 4 Paired Core Values and their associated 12 Guiding Principles.
- The lesson also talked about the difference between Agile and Waterfall. The advantages and disadvantages of each were covered to ensure everyone appreciates that one size does not necessarily fit all projects.
- We finished up by talking about some misconceptions of Agile. If you can avoid such misconceptions, you will become a valuable member of an Agile organization.

In the next lesson:

- We talked about the characteristics of high performing Agile Teams.
- We then proceeded to talk about the size, structure, and skills of a High Performing Team. We discussed how Agile frameworks recommend a team size of between 5-12 skilled resources that are self-organizing and cross-functional with T-shaped skills.
- We looked at Agile governance and how, based on the Agile Manifesto’s guidelines, Agile recommends a lightweight and simple approach to governance. Where possible, decentralized decision-making is encouraged.
- We finished up by talking about some pitfalls in which High Performing Agile Teams disintegrate and how to avoid those situations.
- This lesson emphasized how High Performing help uncover ways to mitigate the impact of threats, as well as profit from opportunities for the organization.

In the final lesson:

- We talked about the value of Agile Frameworks. We discussed how an Agile Framework takes the abstract principles of the Agile Manifesto and gives it a practical shape.
- We then looked at the important characteristics of the Scrum Framework, which is by far the most common Agile Framework in use across various industries globally.
- We proceeded to examine the important characteristics of the Kanban Framework with its origins in lean product development. Kanban is a lightweight Agile Framework with considerable flexibility.
- The final Agile Framework we looked at was XP, a powerful Agile Framework with its roots in software development. We discussed XP’s stringent and strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.
- We finished up by talking about some of the challenges of adopting the XP Framework.

# Project Scenario

## Details About WorldVisitz

### Background

WorldVisitz is a travel agency. WorldVisitz has engaged you as an agile consultant and coach to launch their mobile application solution. This solution will allow customers to book travel with all major airlines. The mobile application will leverage predictive analytics to try and upsell additional travel-related services and offerings.

The executives have advised you they are concerned that the current detailed requirements and specifications document has an 18 months’ estimate for project delivery. They have heard that an Agile approach might help WorldVisitz monetize offerings sooner incrementally.

  

### Team

You have been introduced to the following team members:

|Icon/Name|Current Title|Current Work Style|
|---|---|---|
|Jane Doe|Project Manager|Jane manages the team by focusing on the scope to be delivered, planning the work out primarily herself and assigning work to individuals based on her preference|
|John Smith|Product Manager|John likes to conduct extensive market research and product planning upfront; he is detached from the developers by process, department, and facility boundaries|
|Jim Brady (USA) ,Nathan Connor (USA) ,Venkat Ragu (India) ,Ali Khan (India)|Developers (2 Onshore, 2 Offshore)|The offshore developers are contractors who have more senior technical expertise; they are individually assigned the more complex project deliverables by the Project Manager. The less complex deliverables are individually assigned to the onshore developers by the Project Manager. There is no process to transfer knowledge from the offshore contractors to the onshore developers. There’s a lack of consistent coding standards.|
|Kathy Qualls|Tester|Kathy steps into the process lifecycle once the code has been developed thoroughly. She likes to go through testing and provide full feedback to the Project Manager once she completes her testing cycle|
|Jerry Holden|Business Analyst|Jerry conducts upfront business analysis and product definition; requirements are detailed and frozen early on so a detailed project plan can be followed|
|James Cowx|UX Designer|James builds out UX based on specifications and requirements in the Project Plan created by the Project Manager and Business Analyst. Customer feedback is received late, in market testing and after product launch.|
|Holly Vogt|Subject Matter Expert|Holly prefers one-on-one interviews and calls with the Project Manager and Business Analyst to provide expert opinion and guidance.|


### Additional Details

You had an important meeting with the executives and Product Manager. The executives have shared the following details:

1. In order to launch, WorldVisitz needs to make flights available to purchase from all major airlines. There needs to be a search functionality that allows for a search with the following criteria: dates, one-way/round-trip/multi-city, number of passengers, ages, and number of stops.
2. Travelers must be able to utilize any major credit card to purchase
3. Business Intelligence capabilities in the background should recommend upselling opportunities from partner offerings.
4. WorldVisitz must integrate with services provided by HotelzMotelz, AutoRentalz, Insurancez, and TravelPackagez

  

### Your Task

WorldVisitz executives want you to define an Agile delivery solution to replace their current inefficient traditional product development processes.

The executives are concerned about the current lack of knowledge transfer between team members, as well as not adhering to coding standards. They have also been hearing of a lack of trust and camaraderie between the offshore and onshore resources.

Based on your assessment of the above scenario, you are to proceed with recommending the optimal framework. You will need to help the team launch the appropriate information radiators, ceremonies, as well as assign agile roles to team members.

  

### Timeline

The executives have indicated they strongly prefer some predictable development process where they can get iterative working features that they can launch as and when the business sees fit. They are concerned with the lack of effective knowledge transfer and weak coding standards in the development team. Team members are not co-located, which makes knowledge transfer challenging.

# Instructions

## Detailed Project Instructions

### Task I: Sell the Leadership Team

Your first mission is to convince the WorldVisitz leadership team to adopt an Agile framework by preparing an “Agile Foundations” presentation for the executives.

There are two parts to this first submission.

#### Part 1: How WorldVisitz Can Benefit From Agile

Prepare a presentation for WorldVisitz leadership to articulate the value of WorldVisitz transitioning to an Agile product delivery approach.

Your presentation should include 1 or more slides on each of these topics (not more than 20 slides total).

- An overview of what Agile is, including a description of the Agile Manifesto and why it is important to follow it
- The benefits of Business Agility to WorldVisitz. Your argument should differentiate between Waterfall and Agile and explain why Agile is a more effective solution for WorldVisitz
- A description of the Agile Umbrella including a comparison of each of the three frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, XP)

#### Part 2: The Optimal Agile Framework for WorldVisitz

From the given business scenario, recommend and justify the rationale for WorldVisitz to adopt the optimal framework or combination of frameworks from:

- Scrum Framework
- Kanban
- XP

### Task II: Onboard the Team

Congratulations! Your pitch to management was successful and you have been hired as an Agile Coach to work with the team. Prepare an "Agile Onboarding" presentation to onboard the team and get them started on their Agile journey.

Your presentation should include the following:

- A summary of Agile Benefits for the team
- A recommendation for at least two Information Radiators that the team should use to monitor continual improvement. Include visual examples, as well as its value proposition (an explanation of why that IR is helpful).
    - As discussed on the [_Scrum Ceremonies and Roles_(opens in a new tab)](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd144-01/parts/cd603659-fed4-4e93-97dd-fce3117bfd7a/modules/33e0cf25-2544-4ccd-9e89-fd10eda1367b/lessons/6d99edf2-2e14-4789-bd89-9796c759f5cb/concepts/08f873f6-823d-411b-8ee5-eed16155a563?contentVersion=1.0.0&contentLocale=en-us) page, information radiators are commonly used by Agile teams to track and share progress. Examples of information radiators include Burndown Charts, Burnup Charts, and Velocity Charts.
- A Ceremony Schedule, as well as agenda for each Ceremony along with a reminder of the purpose of each Ceremony respectively.
    - If you are using Scrum, you should follow the Scrum Guide
    - If are using Kanban or XP, you need to create an appropriate schedule that includes a minimum of 3 ceremonies
- Team composition and role assignments for all team members based on the chosen framework
- An appendix, which includes personal notes (not to be shared with the team!) that:
    - Identifies skill gaps or weaknesses for individual team members as well as antipatterns across the team
    - Outlines a training plan using Whole Team Coaching or one-on-one coaching to mitigate the gaps and antipatterns using either the Dreyfus or Shu Ha Ri model.

### Presentation Requirements:

- You may use PowerPoint, Google Slides, or another presentation tool.
- Each presentation should have no more than 20 slides.
- You should use both visual content on the slides and include a written narrative in the speaker notes.
- The narrative may be written in paragraphs or bullet points as long as the bullet points include all of the necessary information.
- The presentation should be downloaded as a PDF that shows both the slide and the speaker notes. See instructions below.
- The presentation will be evaluated on the substance of your arguments, but attractive and engaging visuals are always a plus.
