# 5. Bintoso's Cloud Transformation

# Introduction

## Bintoso’s Cloud Transformation

## Introduction

Bintoso was founded in 1978 as a clothing store in North Carolina. Over the years, it has expanded as a department store serving US customers. They have recently expanded into select locations in Europe.

## Problems facing Bintoso

- Bintoso faces stiff competition from other department stores as well as online retailers.
- The revenues and margins have been trending down.
- The company closed many stores and laid off 10% of its workforce in the last 2 years.
- Bintoso was late in starting its digital transformation journey.

Simone Warel, the new CEO hired last year from a leading online retailer is transforming the company to provide a multi-channel experience.

## Your challenge

Your task is to analyze and propose a cloud strategy for Bintoso. You will be provided multiple artifacts such as:

- Detailed company backgrounder
- Recent income statement
- CEO email exchanges with staff highlighting business challenges and opportunities
- Hierarchical organizational charts
- Email exchanges illustrating culture and siloed mindset
- Financial information on current and upcoming data center costs
- Workload map to Data Centers

You are expected to analyze all artifacts to glean meaningful information to build a cloud strategy. The strategy should cover all core learning objectives

- Identify business problems best addressed with cloud
- Prioritize workloads to maximize ROI
- Define the org model and needed changes in skill levels and processes
- Define a governance model that would mitigate risks and optimize spend
- Propose a new innovative solution on the cloud that would deliver new business benefits (e.g. new revenue stream, improved customer experience, improve operational excellence, etc.)
## Getting Started

- Company Backgrounder
- Org chart
- DataCenter Financials
- CEO email to Senior Leadership Team
- Email from VP of Ops to VP of App Dev
- Email Computer Engineer to VP of Infrastructure
- Workload prioritization spreadsheet

_The rest of the project requires a deep understanding of the information provided, both directly and indirectly, in the provided documentation. Take the time now to get familiar with and read through each of the files._

## Instructions

For each of the tasks below, you will respond to the question prompt and save your response in a separate document, as specified in each task.

- `Business Problems` Task 1

Having read through all of the documents as well as email communications, identify at least 3 business problems that can be addressed with the cloud. For each of the problems, justify how the cloud could address the problem. At least, one paragraph per business problem.

- `Workload to DC map` Task 2

You have read all the company documents - Backgrounder, emails, etc. Knowing what you know about the company. Your task is to fill out two columns in the provided Workload Prioritization sheet.

1. Prioritization Column - P1, P2, P3 where P1 is the highest priority followed by P2 and P3. There is no fixed distribution of prioritization across workloads. However, putting all workloads as P1 would be a bad idea.
2. Justification Column- Use your discretion in justifying the prioritization levels. Justify your rationale based on the data provided. Please keep your responses to 3-4 sentences per justification. Use the following prioritization as a loose guide.
    - CEO has a high-level view of company priorities

    1. Question 1: Assuming Bintoso embarks on the cloud journey without a cloud governance model, identify the four key risks to Bintoso.
    2. Question 2: As discussed in the course, what virtual team structure would be crucial in helping to mitigate the risks? Pick one of the risks that you identified in the previous question, and describe in detail how the virtual team structure would mitigate that risk.
4. `Process Changes` Task 4

Review the provided org chart. Identify at least 2 virtual/overlay team structures or processes that need to be created to drive a successful cloud transformation? In your solution, elaborate on the key stakeholders and purpose of each structure/process. Please keep your response to one paragraph each.

- `Cultural Changes` Task 5

    2. Question 2: What specific actions would you take to drive cultural changes at Bintoso for successful cloud adoption? Identify at least one action for each element in your response to your previous question. Keep your responses to 2-4 sentences per element.
- `Skills Gap` Task 6

        - Cloud Business Management
        - Cloud Infrastructure
        - Cloud Security
        - Cloud applications infrastructure
    2. Review the org chart. Map all the roles under the CIO and CFO against the spheres of responsibility.
        - For instance:`App Developers → Cloud applications infrastructure` Comma separate if a role maps to multiple spheres. * For instance:`Role A → Sphere2, Sphere 4`
- `Innovation Ideas` Task 7

Identify **one area** of business innovation for Bintoso (e.g. new market, new experience, improved efficiency (something that doesn’t exist today). Describe in detail your idea and business benefits. For this response please describe and justify (one or more) of the cloud capabilities _covered in the Cloud Innovation lesson_. Keep your response to 1-2 paragraphs.

### Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out

1. Assume all workloads for Bintoso are now in the cloud, and you have the power to define the new org chart. What would it look like?
    
2. Assume you are the CIO of Bintoso. Bintoso, just acquired a niche online retailer to augment its own online capabilities. The acquired company is on a different cloud provider. How would you handle the situation? Consider people, process, technology implications of your decision when coming up with an answer.
