# 1. INTRO
## How was the course designed?

Every business is either going through a digital transformation or planning to and the cloud is almost always an integral part of it. Cloud computing, has already crossed the chasm and is now mainstream across all industries.

`Cloud is not just a technology, it's a way of doing business.`

### Course organization and flow

When I looked at companies who have gone through digital transformation successfully and those who haven't, I realized I needed to organize this course along 4 vectors:

1. Understanding the business case for cloud and what cloud can do for your business. Once you understand it, then transitioning your existing workloads and creating new workloads requires a strategic approach to maximize your ROI and minimize risks.
2. Transitioning your people, processes, and culture to the new world of the cloud isn't as straightforward as you think. Most leaders, even though they understand the business value of the cloud, underestimate the significance of this transition and instead emphasize cloud technology and strategic roadmap. Taking the existing IT mindset to the cloud just doesn't work.
3. Once you have built the business case, started preparing your organization for the cloud world, and have figured out the workload transition path, you need to think about the governance aspects of the cloud. Everything is code and API-driven in the cloud. The power of code and API is a double-edged sword. While it gives you the speed to move fast with a lot of automation, it can lead to undesirable outcomes if you don't put a governance model before you start building on the cloud or moving your workloads to the cloud.
4. Once you are in the cloud, you can innovate much faster as the cost of experimentation is very low and the payoff could be very high. What Services are provided by the cloud that companies in every industry are using to innovate and in some cases reinvent themselves?

To bring everything home, I then discuss the case of a US company that has successfully transformed itself into the cloud using the approach mentioned above.

# What is Cloud Computing

## Once every 20-30 years change

Cloud Computing is one of the tectonic shifts in the computing models that happens once in a few decades. It has far-reaching implications on:

- **Finance** and **budgets**
- **Security** and **risk posture** as the cloud is multi-tenant and connected to the Internet
- E**ngineering,** and **operations** as everything including infrastructure provisioning happen through code and APIs.

### On-demand, pay as you go

At a high level, cloud computing is an on-demand, pay-as-you-go service model delivered over the internet. Unlike on-prem, you don't need to plan and buy capacity ...you know it will be there when you need it and you can instantly provision it. You don't pay upfront.. you pay for what you use on a monthly basis. And you get those services delivered over the internet by your provider.

## Why should you care?

`It's already a $266,000,000,000 market growing at a CAGR( Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 20% and targeted to exceed half a trillion dollars by 2025.`

### Cloud as a disruptor

If you have been in business for a long time - Imagine when the Internet happened in the 80s and if you had decided to ignore it .. would you still be in business?

What if your competitors embrace cloud and change their business model to out-innovate you? This is simply because cloud gives you business agility that, in most cases, not possible with on-prem infrastructure.

_Every business is becoming a technology business_. Multiple Industries have been disrupted with software innovation. Spotify and Itunes disrupted the music industry, Netflix disrupted the media industry, Amazon disrupted commerce, Lyft and Uber are disrupting transportation, Airbnb is disrupting Hospitality. The list will go on as the technology innovation cycle continues.

# History of Cloud Computing

## History of Cloud Computing

There have been several landmark moments in the history of computing that got us to cloud computing as we know it today. Let's look at the brief timeline of events:

- 1950s : John McCarthy introduced the notion of **time sharing a mainframe**. Mainframes were super-expensive and the notion of timesharing was introduced to drive higher utilization of the computing capacity. This invention made computing affordable to smaller companies who couldn't afford to buy their own mainframes.
- 1960s: J.C.R. Licklider came up with the idea of connecting computers to each other. This led to the creation of **ARPANET**, the predecessor to the internet.
- 1970s: IBM introduced the concept of virtualization by introducing a Virtual Machine operating system. The notion of a hypervisor abstracting hardware to enable virtual machines is a landmark in cloud computing history.
- 1980s and 1990s: There were several advances in computing such as the launch of the **internet** and the **world-wide-web** with the Netscape browser. The Internet revolutionized all industries as companies started to address new business models enabled by the Internet. **Datacenter** spending increased. However, the average utilization rate of infrastructure in IT datacenters continued to be than 20%.
- 1999
    - **Vmware** : Some smart engineers in silicon valley finally cracked this problem of low utilization. They founded a company and introduced Intel x86 hypervisor and virtual machines to the IT world in 1999. Although the concept of virtualization wasn't new, VMWARE solved the hard problem of virtualizing the Intel x86 architecture, the silicon that powered most data center computers. It was an instant hit. Vmware rocked the IT world as virtualization led to server consolidation driving the utilization of data centers significantly up.
    - **SalesForce** launched the concept of Software as a service by delivering sales management software through its own cloud. This led to a big disruption to the traditional shrink-wrapped or packaged software industry.
- 2005 : Sun Microsystems launched the **pay-as-you-go computing model** with $1 cpu/hr pricing for its utility computing offering. Unfortunately, It wasn't commercially successful and was withdrawn soon.
- 2006 : Modern **cloud computing** was seeded by AWS in 2006 with the launch of storage service S3 and soon after its compute service EC2. As a retailer Amazon had lots of scaling challenges and went through a lot of internal changes to grow the business by building a new model that allowed scaling of its infrastructure services. The idea of offering the **IaaS** infrastructure services to others so they can build their own apps was born, and the rest is history.

## I.T. infrastructure investments declining

Investments in traditional IT infrastructure have been declining year over year while public cloud spend is picking. Per IDC, Q2 2020 was the first time when public cloud IT spend surpassed traditional I.T. (infra)structure spend.

# Pre-requisites

## What skills do you need to be successful in this course?

- Students should be able to identify workloads (business processes, applications, etc) within their organization that can be automated or made more efficient.
- Students should be able to identify roles, skills, organizational silos, and procedural constraints within the organization.
- Students should have a basic understanding of information security.
- Students should have a familiarity with current budgeting practices.
- Students should have a familiarity with word processors, spreadsheets, and similar numerical analysis tools, presentation tools.
# Business Stakeholders

`Cloud computing is not just a technology but a way of doing business.`

Therefore, every role is impacted in one way or the other. However, some organizations are going to be more impacted by the adoption of cloud than the others.

## High impact

These people will be highly impacted and will be taking an active part in the transition to the cloud

- In many companies, **CIO** leads the (I)information (T)echnology division and has been responsible for running companies' data centers and applications. _This organization is most impacted_
- **CTO** or **Head of Engineering** who runs engineering for all of the companies IT products and services where these products and services are software enabled. These engineering teams are dependent on infrastructure provisioning by the CIO staff.
- **Head of Information Security** for the company. As we will see, the security model in the public cloud changes significantly.
- **Head of Finance**, as the cloud spend model is Opex driven while the traditional model has been CAPEX heavy.
- **Head of Products** is impacted as the product development lifecycle changes significantly when built on the cloud. Products have to evolve to fit into the cloud's "as a service model" to stay relevant. Many shrink-wrapped software companies die as they couldn't reinvent themselves for the cloud world.

## Medium to low impact

These people are still impacted, but just not as directly as the roles we just talked about

- **CRO** or **Head of Sales**
- **CMO** or **Head of Marketing**
- **HR**
- **Legal**

# Project Overview

## Bintoso's Cloud Transformation

### Scenario

- You will be working with an international clothing company called Bintoso. The organization is facing stiff competition from other department stores as well as online retailers. The revenues and margins have been trending down.
- The previous executive team did not have a forward-thinking strategy, so the new CEO has asked you to lead the digital transformation of the company.

### Background business documents

You will be provided with a wealth of information to help you understand the current culture of Bintoso, including business documents such as

- A detailed company backgrounder
- Recent income statement
- Current financial information on current and upcoming data center costs
- Current hierarchical organizational charts
- Email exchanges between executive team members and staff highlighting business challenges and opportunities

Don't be intimated by those artifacts, once you start with the company backgrounder provided by us, they will all fall into place, and in fact, will give you a really solid picture of the organization

### What will you do?

This is where your project starts. Ultimately, your task is to analyze and propose a cloud strategy for Bintoso. Through your analysis, you will:

- Identify business problems best addressed with cloud
- Prioritize workloads to maximize ROI
- Re-define the organizational model so that it reflects needed changes in skill levels, culture, and processes
- Define a governance model that would mitigate risks and optimize spend, as well as bring automation into the organization

# What is Cloud Computing

## Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is made up of these main aspects

- **ON-DEMAND:** Available when you need it. No need to pre-provision or request in advance. For example, if you need storage for your videos or photos, you can open an account with Google Drive or OneDrive from Microsoft and start uploading your videos and photos right away.
- **DELIVERY OF IT RESOURCES**: Service is delivered over the Internet. No need to be physically collocated to use. In the same example, you access Google Drive and OneDrive as services over the internet.
- **PAY AS YOU GO:** You pay for Metered charges based on consumption. No upfront capital investment required. For example, if you need a server to run an application, instead of buying and making a capital investment, you can open a cloud account with companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google - request a server when you need it and start paying for it by the hour.

Cloud Computing

## Types of service

In the image above, you can see that cloud service providers provide 3 main types of service

- Software application services(**SaaS**)
    - Software as a Service
- _Platform_ services (**Paas**)
    - Platform as a Service
- _Infrastructure_ services (**Iaas**)
    - Infrastructure as a Service

We will dive into each of these in the coming lessons.


# Why Cloud Computing Matters

## Rise in Cloud Adoption

There has been a dramatic rise in cloud adoption across all industries and customer segments. the demand is driven by 4 key business values.

- **Cost savings** - There have been several companies such as Netflix and Capital One that have retired all of their data centers and have reported as much as 50% savings.
- **Productivity** - As companies embrace the cloud, they report significant improvement in productivity - this is due to the elimination of wastage due to over-provisioning. They also report staff productivity improvements due to automation tools and innovative services provided by the CSP (c_loud service provider_).
- **Operational Resilience** - Cloud provides resilient infrastructure and other capabilities that allow you to improve operational resilience and reduce outages due to power disruption, hardware failures, natural disasters, human errors, and security breaches.
- **Business Agility** - Cloud provides an on-demand and elastic set of services allowing your application teams to focus on business value and not deal with infrastructure issues. This frees up people to innovate in your business, use cloud services to scale into new geographies, and enter new markets rapidly. With traditional infrastructure, it could have taken weeks to procure and provision new hardware.

# When do we use /not use Cloud Computing

### Start with a cloud-first approach

Cloud computing makes sense for the vast majority of use cases. It is a fundamental shift in the computing model, so try to always start with a cloud-first approach to new projects.

### (S)ervice (L)evel (A)greements

(C)loud (S)ervice (P)roviders, or CSPs provide an SLA for each of the services they offer, such as:

- Availability, Performance, Security, and Privacy of data, Location of data,
- The process to identify problems and resolution expectations
- eDiscovery and legal hold and so on and so forth.

### Consider bare metal

Most cloud providers provide what's known as "bare metal" offerings that allow your workloads to run directly on physical machines with no virtualization or multi-tenancy.

- If your workload is highly specialized and requires physical access to machines, you may run into limitations.
- Many high-performance computing workloads such as Genomics, Chip-design, Life-sciences, etc are optimized to run on bare metal. Bare metal instance types might be limited so you need to make sure your business needs can be met.

### Does the SLA meet business needs?

If the SLAs can't meet your business needs, you may be better off with moving to another CSP, or consider alternative solutions.

#### Cast study:

From my experience, one of the CSPs had an SLA clause - if they find any objectionable material, they will ask the tenant to remove it within 24 hours failing which they will shut down the tenant. The customer I was working with hosted their own customer data and had a higher SLA with their customers - 72 hours, the CSP's SLA, therefore, did not meet their business requirements. These are the types of business strategy decisions you need to recognize.

# loud Computing Models

## Deployment

- **Private** cloud is not the same as virtualized workloads running in your datacenter. Unlike virtualized workloads running in your data center, private cloud is typically on-demand, elastic, and charged based on consumption. Typically hosted by IT infrastructure team for internal customer
- **Public** cloud is offered by third-party providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle, etc. They house multiple customers on the same shared infrastructure. The systems are not exclusive and can be used by anyone. Third-party providers, Multi-tenant and available to everyone.
- In reality, many organizations end up having a **hybrid** solution that takes advantage of the benefits of each of the deployment types i.e, public cloud, private cloud, on-premises infrastructure. Any combination of public, private, on-premises infrastructure, or edge location
- Some organizations may want to make use of **multiple cloud** providers - they may decide to host certain types of workloads in one public cloud and another type of workload in another public cloud. When 2 or more public clouds are used, the deployment type is commonly referred to as multi-cloud.

![Cloud Services from CSP](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e2bec_cloud-services/cloud-services.png)

tech stack

## Service

Depending on your needs and capabilities, there are several service model options available as you can see in the image above. These models are based on the responsibility split between you and your Cloud Service Provider.

Note: The term **CSP** will be used from now on to refer to a **(C)loud (S)ervice (P)rovider** such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, IBM, etc.

- **IaaS** - In the Infrastructure as a service model, CSP provides you the basic infrastructure services - Compute, Storage, and Network. You are responsible for your application and data, along with all dependencies such as operating systems, databases, queues, language runtimes, etc. This model gives you the most control but you end up managing more components.
- **PaaS** - In the Platform as a service model, the CSP provides platform services you use to quickly build your applications. You are responsible for keeping your application and its data up to date, and the rest is managed by the CSP.
- **SaaS** - In the software as a service model, the CSP delivers the entire application as a service to you. You consume the application as is, with nothing to manage except your own data. Your CSP keeps your application up to date.

#### Description

#### Deployment model

Takes advantage of the benefits of multiple deployment types

hybrid

Typically on-demand, elastic, and charged based on pay-as-you-go consumption

private

Typically multi-tenant with multiple customers on the same shared infrastructure.

public

Typically when more than one public cloud is used

mixed cloud


An e-commerce company has significant operations in Europe with 2 datacenters running a private cloud in Europe serving all its European customers. The company is planning an expansion into the US and for latency and site experience reasons has decided to extend its e-commerce site by hosting it in the US for US customers. It needs to find the fastest way to do it to meet demand. After evaluating all options, the company decided to build a Hybrid cloud. Did they make a good choice?

Yes

# Public Cloud Characteristics and Benefits

## Public Cloud

### Public cloud

You have seen a few of these before when we defined the basics of the cloud. Now Let's discuss what public cloud is and where they are similar or different from private clouds.

- **On-demand** - you can request capacity on demand. Private clouds offer the same model but the capacity might be more limited as compared to the public cloud.
- **Elastic** - You can scale your workloads up and down without planning capacity. Private clouds offer the same but the capacity might be more limited as compared to the public cloud. If you are an online retailer, you need to be able to immediately scale during certain times of the year, such as holidays.
- **Pay as you go** - No upfront payment needed. Your charges are metered based on consumption and you pay as you go. In a private cloud case, the model would be the same and the charges may appear as chargeback or showback to your department.
- **Global reach** - Public cloud covers most global regions and is constantly opening more. A private cloud may be limited in global scale and reach. For example, if you are located in India, you can use a CSP's region in India or close to India to host your application.
- **Multi-tenant** - Other customers may also be using the same cloud and running on the same physical infrastructure. But CSPs manage the isolation between tenants so you don't need to worry about security etc. In the private cloud case, this is true as well with the difference that private cloud is meant for use by departments within the company and will not allow external parties to use it.
- **Security** - Public clouds offer a shared responsibility model where the Security of the cloud is CSP's responsibility. Securing applications running on the cloud is the tenant's responsibility unless you are using the SaaS model where the CSP is responsible for the entire stack as we discussed earlier. The model doesn't apply in private cloud cases since IT applications and infrastructure are all hosted internally.

# R.O.I. of the Cloud

## ROI: Return on Investment

### Business Case for Cloud

### Typical ROI

Let's start with the basics. What is (R)eturn (O)n (I)investment? Here's a simple economic formula for calculating your ROI.

`(gain - investment) / investment`

To understand this formula, let's take a simple example.

Let's say you invest(ment) $100 in the stock market.

At the end of the year, you sell(gain) all your stocks for $140.

Your ROI, in this case, would be (140-100)/100 = 0.4

- Any number **< 1** indicates from a financial point of view, the investment will be far greater than the benefit, which could indicate the _minimal value._
- Any number **> 1** indicates from a financial point of view, the investment will be far less than the benefit, which might indicate _good value_.

The challenge in building ROI models is to accurately quantify **gains**. In some cases the **gains** are straightforward to quantify like the stock market example, in other cases, it may not be as straightforward to quantify **gains**.

### Calculating GAIN

How do you build an ROI model to justify cloud investments?

Remember from earlier that the traditional model for calculating ROI is

`(gain-investment) / investment`

Conventional thinking might be to use cost savings driven model based on **(T)otal (C)ost of (O)wnership** as a basis for building ROI but these models can fall short as they only factor in monetary cost savings but neglect the other business benefits that come with cloud. These additional benefits can add significant value to the monetary **GAIN**

What are these other business benefits?

- Productivity
- Speed
- Size
- Quality
- Operational Resilience

_We will be talking about each of these_!

### TCO: Cost Savings as a first component of Gains.

(Gain - Investment) / Investment

Recall where COST Savings (_**Gain - Investment**_) is in our formula for ROI

The (T)total (C)ost of (O)wnership or TCO is based on the fact that you not only pay to acquire your assets but also incur ongoing costs to maintain and manage them.

Cost Savings = TCO (on-prem) - Forecasted Cloud Spend

To calculate the cost savings, you need to understand the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of your on-premise assets

### Major TCO drivers

This is not a comprehensive list but gives you an idea of things to consider when calculating the TCO.

- Servers, storage, and networks require to be maintained and fixed over their lifetime.
- The same applies to other parts that go in your DC such as racks and assemblies.
- Software licenses need to be maintained and renewed.
- Many assets require 24/7/365 electricity to keep them running efficiently.
- Costs of datacenters buildings and land
- Cooling expenses are sizable and shouldn't be ignored.
- Support staff for maintaining your infra and securing physical access

### Understanding your TCO

Understanding your TCO is the first step in the process. You can then build a TCO model with help from your CSP or a trusted partner. Many CSPs provide on-line Cloud TCO calculators too. [Here is an example of this(opens in a new tab)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/).

In general, most companies have realized significant savings by retiring Datacenters and moving to the cloud. These savings could range from 20% to 50% per surveys done by research firms.

### Other Benefits to Consider in addition to money savings

As we discussed earlier on the page, the traditional ROI model is based on _cost savings_. But, there are _other business benefits_ that might far outweigh the benefits due to purely cost savings.

Your ROI model should include these business benefits to be complete. You need to quantify the value of each of them as applicable to your situation and build an ROI model factoring in these business benefits in addition to cost savings. However, these business benefits are not easy to quantify. Many leaders have made cloud investment decisions based on the qualitative assessments of these benefits.

**Example** - The CIO of GE made an executive decision to move 50 apps to the cloud in 30 days, subsequently retiring most of GE DCs, moving thousands of apps to the cloud over the next 2-3 years.

#### Benefits to consider

- **Productivity**: Eliminating waste and achieving higher productivity
- **Business Agility**
    - **Speed**: How quickly can you respond to your customer needs
        - Provision capacity On-Demand
        - Enable CI/CD
        - Enable new deployment models
    - **Size**: Scale-up and reach a global audience
- **Quality**: Focus on your core differentiators by eliminating undifferentiated heavy lifting
- **Operational Resilience**: Utilize resilient infrastructure, tooling, and security of cloud

### Productivity

![Opportunities in Productivity](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e2e7d_productivity2/productivity2.png)

Opportunities in Productivity

### Removing wastage and avoiding missed opportunities

Your infrastructure needs are never the same throughout the year or year over year.

In the image above, we can see a hypothetical demand curve for the infrastructure needs for a growth business over many years

- Dotted green line(_predicted demand_): Since you can't predict demand accurately for many years out, you typically forecast infrastructure demand for the next 1-2 years based on input from IT and business teams and procure additional infrastructure
- Solid black line(_traditional hardware_): In real life, your infrastructure demand and utilization fluctuates as seen here
- Solid pink: (_Actual demand_). This is what actually happens

### The problems with this model ?

First you are making a large upfront capital expenditure

1. **Large upfront capital expenditures**. Your money is already accounted for well in advance
2. **Opportunity cost:** Since you are incurring an opportunity cost due to idle infrastructure capacity. Wouldn't it be nice if you could use this money for other business priorities?
3. **Unexpected jumps in demand** for infrastructure: During this time, you lose customers while waiting for new capacity from procurement. This is represented by the shaded area.

Cloud eliminates all of these problems by allowing you to provision capacity on demand

**Automated cloud capacity:** This can be closely matched to your demand curve. The result:

- No more large **capital expenditure**
- No wastage of **resources**
- No need to **plan capacity** in advance
- Never **lose your customers** due to infrastructure issues.
- Significantly **improve the operational efficiency** of your business.

### Speed

Speed matters in business. Businesses that can quickly react to changes in market conditions and adapt to external changes thrive. Companies such as Netflix and Amazon do thousands of production deployments per day.

The way this speed is accomplished is through automated processes called Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployments also known as **CI/CD.**

- **Continuous integration** refers to the process when as soon as a developer checks in his code a set of processes automatically start that would build or compile the code and put the code through several tests.
- **Continuous deployment** refers to the subsequent stage when the tested code also called "build" from the previous stage is moved to a staging area that mimics the production environment for more testing. When the tests pass, the build is deployed to production.

Cloud is a great enabler for speed. Cloud provides services that facilitate this CI/CD pipeline along with necessary tooling and observability metrics needed.

Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

### Blue-Green Deployment

Imagine your existing running app, known as **Blue Deployment**. Let's say you want to upgrade the app to a new release.

You can replicate the entire infrastructure along with the new application code and seamlessly direct all users to the new deployment also called **Green Deployment.** If something goes wrong in the **Green Deployment** you can seamlessly redirect all users back to the original deployment.

It's much easier done in the cloud. Imagine you have an app that runs on 50 servers. You'll need to keep another 50 servers idle to do **Blue-Green** on-prem. In the cloud, you can quickly spin up new capacity and de-provision old capacity when not needed.

![Blue Deployment](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e304a_blue/blue.png)

Blue Deployment

#### Blue deployment

Blue deployment allows you to keep the previous version running while making sure that your Green deployment (new version) rolls out and is tested. With a cloud solution, this can be easily done with minimal cost and infrastructure.

![Green Deployment](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e3062_green/green.png)

Green Deployment

#### Green deployment

As you roll out a new version of your application (**Green** deployment), the previous version can be maintained relatively easily with services in the cloud. If there are any issues with the new version roll out, you can easily revert back to the **Blue** deployment. Consider the amount and cost of resources that would be required for an organization that housed all it's own hardware and software; essentially an organization would have to maintain 2 independent sets of all necessary hardware and software.

#### Speed Takeaways

- **Provision capacity On-Demand** to eliminate planning and provisioning time
    
- **Enable CI/CD** to speed up deployment
    
- **Enable new deployment models** that allow for quick deployment and easy rollback if needed
    

### Size

Cloud reduces the risk of entering new markets

- Easy to provision and manage new capacity
- Lower cost to exit if the expansion doesn't succeed

Existing businesses can leverage the cloud for market expansions and new product introductions to reduce risk

### Quality

#### Working capital efficiency

Lower costs improve working capital efficiency.

As cloud services improve your cost model and free up capital locked in infrastructure, the freed up capital now drives better experiences for customers. For instance - Netflix made a decision to exit datacenters and move to the cloud as they wanted to focus on an awesome video delivery experience for customers and not worry about infrastructure issues.

#### Business Centric services

Mindset shift towards customers and business-centric services

As you free your organization up from infrastructure operations and management, you can start shifting the mindset of your technology teams from IT-centric services to business-centric services. This results in a significant improvement in quality. It is not an easy transition requiring cultural and process changes that we will discuss later in the course.

### Operational resilience

_Eliminating Unplanned Outages_

How does the cloud address this issue?

- Cloud provides a **resilient infrastructure** to protect against hardware failures, natural disasters, power outages, and network outages.
- Cloud provides tooling for **infrastructure automation** allowing you to reduce outages caused due to human errors.
- CSPs hire world-class **security** experts to protect the cloud itself and offer security services to improve your overall security posture. The net result, if done right you'll be more secure in the cloud as compared to on-prem
- Software deployment into production through **CI/CD** pipeline and related services reduce outages caused due to software issues.

# Motivations for Cloud Adoption

## Business motivations

Your business motivations should help you set the right goals and a strategy to adopt the cloud. Here are some typical business motivations.

- **Cost savings** is a common one as people look to exit datacenters and eliminate capital expenses and associated operational expenses.
- As companies succeed and grow across geographies and enter new markets, **scaling** becomes a challenge. Cloud gives them a vehicle to scale.
- CSPs bring in **innovative technologies and services** that significantly shorten the release cycles allowing companies to respond to market needs faster.
- **Creating a new product or service** with disruptive potential and scaling is best done on the cloud. The cloud **reduces the cost of entry.**
- Scaling your IT **elastically** to match customer expectations isn't easy. Cloud's elasticity and **geographic reach** allow you to improve customer experience.
- Outages are expensive and cost you a lot of money in lost revenue and damaged brand. Cloud's **resilient infrastructure** and other capabilities allow you to reduce outages.

# Migration Strategies

![Migration Strategies](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/January/60147f38_migrationst/migrationst.png)

Migration Strategies

## Migration Strategies

Consider the image above. Imagine you have built the business case and are now ready to adopt the cloud. Where do you start?

The first step is to _**discover all your apps**_. You can use commercially available tools to discover and inventory your apps if you don't have one already.

1. From the inventory of apps, identify the ones you want to **retain**. This could be due to regulatory compliance or other reasons.
2. Identify the ones that are no longer relevant or not in use - plan to **retire** or sunset them.
3. Of the remaining - classify them in three buckets:
    - "**Sustain**" - These are apps that do not core or strategic to your business success but you need them. They are doing their job just fine and don't need any performance or scalability boost. For example - legacy apps running on mainframes may fall into this bucket. Your strategy, called **rehost**, should be to lift and shift them to the cloud with no modifications.
    - "**Optimize**" - These are your custom apps that are important and enablers for your business. Finance, HR, Sales management applications are some examples. See if you can find an equivalent SaaS application that can replace it(**re-purchase)**. If there is no suitable SaaS equivalent, you may want to "Lift and Reshape" (**re-platform**) the application taking advantage of cloud features. For instance, you may want to replace your own database with a cloud-managed database. This should require very little change.
    - "**Grow**" - These apps are core to your business and often are revenue-generating apps. For instance, if you are in retail, this could be your online store app. You may want to put investment into re-architecting (**re-factor**) to make it cloud-native taking advantage of as many cloud features and capabilities as possible.

![Workload priorities](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e3943_workoad-prior/workoad-prior.png)

Workload priorities

## Workload Prioritization

Prioritizing workloads in the cloud:

- Make sure that you have a low friction way of giving developers sandbox accounts so they can learn, try out things. In addition to formal training and certification, this would be one of the fastest ways to get your organization ready for cloud adoption.
- Any new application should be built on the cloud. Again, this is a great way for your organization to learn the nuances of the cloud and apply the learning to other workloads.
- Applications classified as "Grow" in your migration planning phase should receive focus next, as they are critical to your business success.
- Prioritize all other workloads based on business priorities. For instance, If cost savings is a top business priority, and if you can avoid renewing a data center lease coming up for renewal, you should prioritize migrating applications hosted in that datacenter.
# Quiz: Migration Strategies

### Quiz Question

These are the correct matches.

What apps will you keep

Retain

What apps will you sunset

Retire

Is there a cloud service that can accomplish the same thing as the existing app

Repurchase

Can you rebuild the app using new cloud features

Refactor

"Lift and Shift" directly to the cloud

Rehost

"Lift and Reshape" Is there a better way to accomplish result using the cloud

Replatform

### Quiz Question

A company is in financial services industry. Match the application description with an appropriate 6R migration strategy

These are the correct matches.

#### Application

#### Migration Strategy

Application was built for a certain use case that's no longer relevant as the company has changed direction

Retire

This application has very sensitive financial data and CFO has mandated that this application should never leave the datacenter

Retain

Company had a homegrown application built 15 years ago managing customer's profile, sales, and service records

Repurchase

Company has a custom order management application that has specialized business logic and runs on Linux and MySQL

Replatform

Company's core application is consumer banking app that was developed several years ago. It takes a lot of time to respond to fast changing customer needs as application modules are tightly linked with several interdependencies making changes expensive and time consuming

Re-Architect

A legacy backend application is used to process transactional sales and generating special reports for audit purposes. The auditing standard and requirements haven't changed in years nor are likely to change in the coming years.

Lift and Shift


# Exercise IT Interview

## IT Interview: Application portfolio

### Exercise 2

Review your IT application portfolio by scheduling time with your IT program manager or requesting a list of applications from your IT contact.

#### Part 1

Identify several applications that exist that fall under **each** of the categories (**Sustain**, **Optimize**, **Grow**).

#### Part 2

Identify and justify at least one application in **each** of the categories - **Sustain**, **Optimize**, **Grow**. In your response, include

- Describe the application, including its value
- Justify why it should be sustained, optimized, or grown.

_Note: If you are unable to obtain the list of applications or the scenario above doesn’t apply to you you can use the attached “ Fictitious company - list of applications” to complete this exer_cise

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

## Sample SolutionExercise 2

- Our IT application portfolio has 120 applications. After browsing through the list, a few standouts in each of the categories.
- Sustain:
    - Order Processing application: This is a backend application that has been running reliably, processing transactions. It is mission-critical but doesn’t need to change. Best to lift and shift this app.
- Optimize
    - Exchange Servers: The Microsoft email system can be moved to Office 365 SaaS application
- Grow
    - eCommerce site: This is a core business application exposed to customers on multiple devices - mobile, PC, Mac, and Web. Need to invest in this app to keep up with changing customer needs
## Applications and service models

### Exercise 3

Use the list of applications you obtained from your IT contact. Alternatively, you can use attached “Fictitious company - list of applications” to complete this exercise. Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

Identify and justify at least one business application or need applicable to your company in each of the following categories.

- **SaaS**: Name at least one SaaS application vendor that can broadly meet the need.
- **PaaS**: Describe the PaaS services you’d need from a cloud provider. Justify why SaaS isn’t a good fit.
- **IaaS**: Describe the IaaS service you’d need from a cloud provider and justify why SaaS and PaaS aren’t good fits.
## Solution

- **SaaS:** Microsoft Office 365 can retire our on-prem(ise) mail systems and mail applications.
- **PaaS:** eCommerce site is quite complex and can be re-architected using microservices/containers and serverless services from the cloud. It is a custom application and a big differentiator so it doesn't make sense to replace this with a SaaS app.
- **IaaS:** Order processing application. It is a custom application with logic that’s unique to our business. An equivalent SaaS application doesn’t exist. Moving it to PaaS would require re-architecting the application which doesn’t make economic sense. Best to lift and shift this app on IaaS.

# Expert Perspectives and Best Practices

## Expert Intuition and Perspective

### Things to be aware of and think about

#### Quick wins

This helps earn trust as well as bring attention to the effort

#### Be aware of naysayers

Your initial results may not demonstrate ROI .. look for inflection points to demonstrate the results. When you are moving workloads .. your costs are going to be higher. It's only when you have retired a DC that’s when a measurable success point happens.

#### Developers want to learn!

Have a process to allow new experimental workloads, it's the best place to try out new things at a very low cost. Have a process to allow anyone in your organization to get a sandbox. Your business teams would love the agility, your developers would love the empowerment and learning … and this is one of the best ways to use the cloud to get a business advantage

#### Focus less on cost and more on innovation

Cost savings help, but cost alone is not enough to justify moving to the cloud. Examples of business cases for innovation include:

- AirBnb provisions more rooms per day than established hotel chains without owning a single room.
- Uber is a large transportation company without owning a single cab.

#### Best practices are evolving!

CSPs are constantly adding new services and patterns and practices are changing everyday. Be ready for this evolution!


# Quiz: Best Practices

### Quiz Question

You are the CIO of a mid-size company in the Commercial Logistics and transportation sector and have convinced your CEO to move to the cloud. 30 out of 50 apps from your data center in Amsterdam have moved to the cloud. Your CFO is concerned that the costs have been going up and is not sure if the cloud decision was a good one. How would you convince your CFO and CEO to stay the course? (Select all good answers)

- [ ] We are at the risk of getting disrupted by new business models and the likes of Uber and Lyft unless we reinvent ourselves. Cloud is the best vehicle for us to innovate fast.

- [ ] It is expected that the costs will rise since we are still operating our datacenter and in addition have added cloud expenses. When all 50 apps have moved to allow us to retire our DC in 2022, that's when you'll see significant cost savings

- [ ] We have been at the risk of outages since we only operate out of a single datacenter. Cloud will protect our business from potential outages as the cloud is multi-datacenter and multiple regions giving our business operational resilience.

# 3. Organizational Capability Building


# Lesson Outline

## Lesson outline

In this lesson, we will focus on Organizational Capability Building that is so important for the successful adoption of the cloud. _Many cloud endeavors fail or stall due to executives not paying enough attention to this topic._

## In this lesson:

- We will start by building an understanding of different components of Organizational capabilities.
- We will consider why Organizational Capability Building is important in the bigger picture
- What's the ideal target state you should be striving for and how can you get there.
- How do you evaluate your people and skills needed in the organization and bridge the skill gaps?
- There are many changes your organization will need to adapt to reach the target state. Process and Culture are two of the most important. As part of that, implementing a new virtual structure called a CCOE is extremely important
- How do DevOps and DevSecOps intersect to play a critical part in Organizational Capability Building
- What is FinOps and How does FinOps play a part in Organizational Capability Building.
- Finally, we will look at some best practices and other expert perspectives on this topic

# What is Organizational Capability Building

## Building organization capabilities

Organization capabilities are built to transform environmental inputs such as customer feedback, market trends, technology trends into outputs such as products or services for your customers.

![Organizational capability building benefits](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e38f2_organ-capab/organ-capab.png)

Organizational capability building benefits

If we look deeper, organizational capabilities are built around three key pillars -

1. **People**
2. **Process**
3. **Technology**

In simple terms, it's a combination of professional skills, processes defining how things get done, and technology that allows inputs to convert to outputs. What binds them together is the culture that's unique to an organization and in many cases a differentiator

## The Impact

When you are done with changes in **People**, **Process**, **Technology**, and **Culture** you should see the pervasive impact throughout your organization. You can see the effectiveness of the changes in terms of

- The increased **speed** that's measured by how quickly you can respond to changing inputs to produce outputs
- And a higher rate of **innovation** measured by the number of innovative products and services you introduce to delight your customers.

# Why do you need to build new organizational capability ?

## Re-evaluating your organizational capabilities

A big technology change such as the cloud requires you to re-evaluate your **organizational capabilities**. You need to bring this big of a change in harmony with the other pillars of your organization:

- **People**
- **Processes**
- **Culture**

Many cloud projects stall or fail due to leadership f_ailure to recognize_ the need for this balance. Most people think of the cloud as a destination. Few realize that the cloud is not a destination but an entirely different way of running a business.

## The Impact

![Organizational impact](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e3a7c_org-impact/org-impact.png)

Organizational impact

- Moving to _pay as you go_ means a change in your **financial model** from CAPEX to OPEX
- **Procurement** isn't negotiating commercial license agreements anymore with software and hardware vendors. They now work with cloud vendors and negotiate discounts based on consumption commitments.
- **Engineering teams** who were used to raising tickets for servers, storage and networking infrastructure provisioning now have the power to provision infrastructure as code in the API-driven provisioning model in the cloud.
- **InfoSec teams** who had to end the responsibility of securing physical and logical access to apps and infrastructure, now share this responsibility with the CSP. So they need to evolve their practices in line with this new shared responsibility model.
- **Legal and Compliance** complexities come from the fact that the cloud provider has a global presence, offers many services, and is constantly rolling out new services. This poses new challenges as developers adopt new services and provision infrastructure around the globe. Earlier the IT assets were limited to maybe a few data centers in a known location.
- **IT operations** earlier favored stability over feature changes. To support business agility in the cloud, the focus of IT operations is now shifting towards supporting frequent changes while still ensuring stability. This requires a different approach to build and deploy features.
# Target State Model

## What is Target State

Your target state is never an end state. In the cloud world, the only constant is _**CHANGE**_. But you know the organizational capabilities you are building are effective when you begin to see results in these 4 key buckets.

- **Speed**
    - You should be seeing an order of magnitude more changes getting rolled out to customers. For reference, companies such as Amazon and Netflix do 1000s of deployments per day. While it took them many years to get to this level of maturity, it should give you an idea of what to aim for that's best for your business.
- **Innovation**
    - The cost of experimentation is very low in the cloud. The Organizational capabilities you enable should result in a culture of risk-taking and innovation.
- **Collaboration**
    - No more silos. Application teams not just build apps but are responsible for running them too. Security is everyone's responsibility and needs are baked in the process. No more security check gates. Everyone is watching for costs and optimal spending. It's no longer purely a finance dept. check.
- **Efficiency**
    - Measure the new efficiency you gained by reducing your spending on undifferentiated activities. Long ago, I was interviewing with a startup that was building intelligent network processing cards that go into servers and offload certain operating system network processing in hardware. The founder of the company told me - 60% of his funds go into building a basic network card before he can add intelligence to it. Cloud allows you to just build what your core differentiators are leaving the heavy-lifting of infrastructure and operations to CSP.

## How do we get there?

- **People and Skills**
    - People and Skills - No change is possible without people's support and appropriate skill set for the new world. Often it is people who become the blockers, so you need to handle this part carefully.
- **Culture**
    - Process and Culture feed off of each other. A forced process change without the accompanying culture would face resistance. As a leader, you need to build the mindset for change before introducing the change. We will look at some of the cultural philosophies and practices commonly in play at companies that have successfully adopted the cloud.
- **Process**
    - Cloud requires things to be done differently. Treating the cloud as just another hosted data center and carrying on-prem practices to the cloud is a common mistake. We will discuss a mechanism called cloud center of excellence also known as CCOE that can be instrumental in the adoption of new processes and practices.

Process and Culture feed off of each other. A forced process change _without_ the accompanying culture would face resistance.

`As a leader, you need to build the mindset for change before introducing the change.`

# People & Skills

## People and Skills

The passion and skills of the people in your organization are where you need to start. Many cloud projects stall or fail because of resistance from within the organization or lack of understanding of why this change is good for the people and for the business. In addition, the rapid pace of digital transformation is driving a shortage of skills in the industry.

_The answer lies in motivating your own employees to upskill themselves._

As we said before, the people, processes, and culture changes are all interlinked and need to be driven together, leading you to your desired target state.

### People in your organization

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60638d32_spheres/spheres.png)

The Spheres of Responsibility

### Spheres of responsibilities in the cloud

As you see in the image above, there are essentially 4 spheres of responsibilities in the cloud where you need to map your existing people.

- **Cloud Business Management** sphere is about managing your business needs to cloud. Things such as budgets, application portfolios, migration strategies, and plans are all managed by roles that map to this sphere. For instance program management, financial analysts, or controllers would map to this sphere.
- **The Cloud Infrastructure** sphere is about planning and managing types of instances, networks, storage services, or disaster recovery. The infrastructure architect and the infrastructure Ops engineer is responsible for creating reusable templates and assets for infra provisioning and operations.
- **The Cloud Security** sphere is about ensuring organization security and compliance policies are architected into the applications and infrastructure. Cloud providers have a "_Shared responsibility_" model where the security of the cloud itself is CSP's responsibility but anything that's built on top becomes the customer's responsibility.
- **Cloud Application Infrastructure** sphere is about building and provisioning application assets in the cloud using cloud services such as databases, queues, etc. The DevOps model which will be covered later allows the DevOps engineering and application developers to collaborate to ensure the application meets the required functional as well as non-functional needs of the business. These non-functional needs may include performance, scalability, uptime, etc.

### Cloud Enterprise Architect

The Cloud Enterprise Architect that may map to the Enterprise Architect role in your organization goes across all spheres, aligned with the businesses to make sure the business needs can be met with the cloud platform.

#### Example

Application architects along with DevOps may package the infrastructure provisioning in the code itself for dynamic provisioning of infra and apps. We will discuss this deeper when we talk about DevOps and DevSecOps.

### Bridging Skills Gaps

We did a rough mapping of roles in the cloud world. If those roles are to be played by your existing staff, they need to upskill themselves. This is the hard part. Why?

- **Realize**
    - _People generally have a resistance to change_. They like to be in their comfort zone where they hold a position of power. It is not natural for people to unlearn and then learn new skills.
- **Motivate**
    - _Start with yourse_lf. Take a course or two or perhaps a certification. Assure people that learning together is fun and that there is no risk to their current job. Reward appropriate behaviors. Also, make sure they do something with new skills so training isn't just an academic exercise. Providing sandboxes is one of the ways.
- **Scale and Attract**
    - As pockets of learnings happen throughout the organization, make sure the cloud-savvy community is growing by _sharing their learnings_. Once the word goes out, this would attract external talent too.
# Process : CCoE

## CCoE

### (C)loud (C)enter (o)f (E)xcellence

Addressing skill gaps is important, but you also need to think about the process and cultural changes needed to embrace the cloud.

`Process and Culture feed off of each other.`

There is a powerful mechanism called **Cloud Center of Excellence** that has proven to be successful in driving the process as well as cultural change at scale in large organizations. Once you understand the concept and motivation behind CCOE, you can adapt it to fit your specific needs. Some organizations may refer to it as _Cloud Program Office_ or _Cloud Business Office._ While CCOE will get you started on this big change, you need to be aware of a couple of other things as well that will need to be part of this effort

- Cultural changes such as **DevOps** and **DevSecOps** to help drive agility in your business
- Changes in your financial model from _Capex to Opex._ You need to be aware of a growing concept called **FinOps**. FinOps practices would allow you to manage the change in the financial model introduced by the cloud. _At its core, FinOps is also a cultural practice._

These structures, processes, and cultural changes will enable your organization to get the best out of your cloud investments.

### CCoE

- **What is CCoE?** CCOE is not a permanent structure, but instead _a virtual_ team consisting of people from different functions such as Engineering, Operations, Finance, Business, and Security. CCOE gets its sponsorship from a C-level leader typically CIO or CTO
- **Why do I need it?** You don't have to have a CCOE but it has been proven to be very successful in removing the blockers and accelerating cloud adoption, especially in large organizations with multiple business units.
- **What does it deliver?**
    - **Governance** - We will cover Governance in the next lesson but just know that CCOE will ensure adherence to all of your organizational policies through tooling and automation. These policies scan across security and compliance, cost management, and other areas.
    - **Brokerage** - CCOE can assist users in selecting cloud providers, architect the cloud solution(s) and collaborate with the sourcing team for contract negotiation and vendor management.
    - **Community** - Raise the level of cloud knowledge in the organization and capture and disseminate best practices through a knowledge base, source code repository, training events, outreach throughout the organization, and more.

### CCoE structure

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e3e3b_ccoe/ccoe.png)

Business Units image

As you see in the image above, the CCOE typically sits outside the **(B**)usiness **(U**)nits and provides its services to multiple BUs. For example, a consumer durable manufacturing company such as LG or Samsung may have separate BUs for refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, etc. In addition to an enterprise-wide central IT organization, each BU may have its own specific IT organization.

### CCOE functions

- **Business**
    - On the business side, CCOE works with all BU stakeholders to identify business priorities, creates onboarding plans for identified workloads, consolidates BU needs to negotiate contracts with cloud vendors, and puts control around organizational policies. It manages risks and compliance with a proper governance model as well. It also implements policies and controls to ensure cloud spend is optimized.
- **Technical**
    - CCOE acts as an enabler for all application teams supporting different BUs, provides a set of shared services, provides reusable assets such as templates, code, etc. In addition, as a champion of cloud, CCOE also runs training and education events for cloud skills enablement of the entire organization.

In practice, the business and technical functions are sometimes difficult to separate as they are very much intertwined.

### For example

Cost management spans across vendor contracts as well as engineering practices which if not managed well, can lead to wasted cloud spend.

---

_CCOE exists as a change agent to drive cloud adoption across the enterprise. As different teams become proficient in utilizing cloud over time, the need for CCOE should diminish_.

# Culture

## Typical Current State

There is tremendous value in figuring out your current state. Be willing to ask hard questions and really dig to determine the truth.

Below are several of the most common states in a typical large legacy enterprise. _If your organization can relate to any of these, it might be an indication that changes are needed._

- **Big Releases**
    - To avoid risks, they plan for big releases only with a typical frequency of once or twice a year. This also helps amortize overhead costs.
    - **Changes needed:** Instead of big releases, you need to plan and release small changes. Many organizations such as Netflix and Amazon do thousands of changes per day.
- **Functional Silos**
    - Organizations have functional silos that excel in what they do but this structure is not designed for high-frequency releases. This structure was optimized for maximizing quality and stability over speed which made sense for those times when the market demands didn't change at the pace they change today. These can include
        - Business groups such as marketing, sales, finance
        - Appdev
        - Operations
        - Infrastructure
        - InfoSec
        - Enterprise Architecture
    - **Change needed:**
        - This would require a _collaborative_ approach that cuts through all functional silos. So for instance, if there is an outage, everyone takes ownership to resolve it. It's not just an operations job.
        - risk-taking is an important part of the culture. if things break, they can be rolled back. If you are on the Agile transformation path, you are partly there!
        - the rest would come from DevOps and DevSecOps practices. (We will cover DevOps and DevSecOps in the next lesson. )
- **Low Deployment Rate**
    - The rate of deployments is relatively low. Again, This is by design as the organization and processes were designed to meet the then prevailing business needs. real Example?
    - **Change needed**: You shouldn't be afraid of increasing the frequency of deployments. If things break in production, you can always rollback.
- **Technical Deb**t
    - As businesses feel the need to respond fast, they ask for more. In the current operating structure, IT responds by taking shortcuts causing technical debt to start mounting. real Example?
    - **Change needed**: While making all these changes won't reduce your existing technical debt, it would certainly not make it worse. This is because the changes allow you to operate at the speed of the business now.
# Exercise: People in the Organization

## HR Perspective: Your people

### Exercise 1

Assume you are the head of HR for your company. Your CEO values the Cloud as imperative and has asked you to come up with a plan to assist other engineering and business leaders with cloud transformation. Identify 3 key problem areas from an HR perspective and justify key steps you would take to enable this transformation. Consider elements of culture, skills, and people.

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

# Solution Exercise 1

## Solution

3 key problem areas:

- Motivating employees to re-invent themselves:
    - Sign up with 3rd party training companies (such as Acloud.guru, Udacity etc.) to make cloud training available to employees at enterprise discounts.
    - Work with BU heads to launch new initiatives to encourage employees to learn new skills. BU heads can lead by example by taking courses such as “CCBL” from Udacity and discuss the significance of a growth mindset in town halls.
    - Launch quarterly “Hackfests” and hackdays in partnership with cloud providers.
- Creating a culture of risk-taking and experimentation
    - Work with finance and BU heads to create new programs such as letting employees work on their favorite cloud projects for 10% of their time.
    - Rewards and recognition for top innovators in quarterly town halls.
    - Ensuring there is low friction for employees to get access to cloud sandboxes
    - Build executive education programs to help executives remove silos, understand the significance of collaboration across business units, IT, Operations, etc, and redefining metrics of success for collaborative teams and not just individual functions.
    - Re-examining team structures and ensuring teams are small in size (10-12 people at most)
- Attracting new talent to help with cloud transformation
    - Market the cultural transformation initiatives (e.g. employees get 10% of their time to work on their favorite cloud projects) at the company
    - Publish case studies of cloud led innovation at the company
    - Run targeted campaigns with the help of your key employees who can speak to the work environment at your company and the ground floor opportunity to drive a key transformation.
# DevOps and DevSecOps

### DevOps

How do we evolve the culture to adopt the changes we just talked about?

- **Culture**: DevOps is a culture where business analysts or product managers, application developers, testers, and operations all work together as one team with a singular focus _- deliver features to customers with quality and at a high velocity,_
- **Process automation and tooling**: They accomplish these goals by developing automation frameworks and tools that remove manual processes and error-prone delivery. In a perfect DevOps world, the moment code is checked in by a developer, a series of automation tasks are spun up to build, test, and verify things. When all checks pass, the code is automatically deployed to production. Monitoring and observability tools and frameworks give real-time visibility to developers so they can take corrective action if needed through code modifications.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment**: We have talked about Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment in an earlier lesson. They are an integral part of DevOps culture.

### DevSecOps

DevSecOps is a modification of the DevOps culture where security as a practice is also included.

- **Shift-left security**: 'The core idea here is to "shift-left" security earlier in the development cycle and make it an integral part of the DevOps practice.
- **Part of the DevOps teams**: In the DevSecOps world, Infosec architects become part of the DevOps teams helping deploy secure code to production.
- **Security as a "gate"**: This eliminates security as a "Gate" in the pre DevOps days where things would slow down due to back and forth between Dev, Ops, and Infosec teams.

### DevOps Cycle

The traditional DevOps environment has evolved into a typical cycle as shown in the image below.

- The team starts with planning a change that developers code.
- The changes go through the Continuous Integration/continuous deployment process
    - Build
    - Test and
    - Release
- The Production team
    - Operates the environment
    - Monitors the environment
    - Observes the running environment

Then the team returns to the top of the cycle planning of the next change to either improve the existing environment for scale and efficiency or introduce a new feature.

By planning small changes and rolling them back as needed, the team is able to deploy many changes in a day.

![Phases of the DevOps Cycle](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e41d8_devops-cycle/devops-cycle.png)

DevOps Cycle

### DevSecOps Cycle infused into DevOps Cycle

DevSecOps overlays security functions on the DevOps processes and makes security an integral part of the cycle. You can see this DevSecOps cycle overlayed onto the DevOps cycle we looked at earlier on the page.

The team implements different security features throughout the entire process:

- Defining security policies and threat modeling at the planning stage. The team may refine the threat model based on observed security incidents from the prod environment.
- Static analysis of the code for security flaws is done in the **code** and **build** stages. Manual **code reviews** combined with **automated static code analysis** are typical at this stage and are integrated with the CI/CD pipeline.
- Several **security tests** are run in the Test stage including Pen testing. When all tests pass the pipeline moves to the deploy stage.
- Ensuring tamper-proof logs are archived for audit purposes and forensic analysis as part of security incident response is an important step during the deploy stage.
- When the system is in operation, **threat intelligence tools** and platforms collect information from diverse sources to mitigate threats such as Advanced Persistent threats, Zero-day attacks.
- Security is continuously **monitored**, **intrusions detected** and **responded to** using tools and automation from a combination of CSP services and third-party tools.
- Security incidents if any are **recorded for analysis** and continuous improvements, with a focus on quick recovery to avoid downtime.
- Similarly, security **compliance validation** is done on a continuous basis and violations reported immediately for automated or manual remediation. A combination of CSP services and third-party tools allows you to stay compliant to security standards such as CIS or NIST benchmarks and even controls provided by industry-specific compliance standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and Hi-trust.

The DevOps processes lead to a model where security is everyone's responsibility and the team is able to move fast by eliminating security gates in the pre-DevOps world. The security posture is significantly improved as security is now _baked in_ and not _bolted on_.

DevSecOps Cycle

#### What do DevOps and DevSecOps practices deliver?

- High-velocity deployments to production
- Rapid feedback and iteration based on the feedback
- Agility and responsiveness to customer needs

### DevOps in Waterfall and Agile Methodologies

In the image below, you can see the time differences of deployment for all of the methodologies.

- **Waterfall** model of deployment: each function hands over its output to the next function. When the build is fully tested, it gets handed over to Operations for deployment. This process was designed for big releases and can take _**months**_.
- **Agile** model of deployment: This movement in the developer community came into existence to break big releases down into smaller chunks. It helped _accelerate_ the processes as many in-efficiencies of waterfall got eliminated in this model and reduces time to _**weeks**_. However, there was still a _separation_ that existed between DevTest and Operations organizations as DevTest would handover the build to operations for deployment. The separation caused issues such as "_It works in Dev/Test environment but breaks in production_". Also, there was limited observability of the production environment so Developers couldn't improve things fast enough.

![Waterfall & Agile & DevOps & DevSecOps](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e41fb_waterfall-agile/waterfall-agile.png)

Waterfall & Agile & DevOps & DevSecOps

### Quiz Question

Refresher: Technical debt is when ___ .

the rate of change of business requirements exceeds the rate of change sustainable by IT.

the rate of change sustainable by IT exceeds the rate of change of business requirements

Submit

### Does this DevSDecOps model address technical debt?

While Agile helps, it is not sufficient to drive the velocity required. It can still take weeks.

### Impact of DevOps and DevSecOps culture

DevOps and DevSecOps culture bring all functions together in one team to plan and iteratively deliver features at a higher velocity without compromising security and quality. There are no silos and no handoffs. The release velocity can now be in _**days**_ and even _**hours**_ with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. _Think of how innovative you can be with this type of flexibility._

### Characteristics of a DevOps culture

_What is it that sets DevOps culture apart?_

- DevOps teams **plan and release small change**s. They are easier to manage and rollback is a lot easier. Companies such as Netflix and Amazon do thousands of deployments per day.
- **Close-knit collaborative teams**: DevOps is a culture and the core of the culture is close-knit collaborative teams that have a singular focus. No more Developers saying "_Ops resists changes_", and Ops saying "D_evs deliver crappy builds that break production_".
- The singular focus of DevOps teams is to deliver **secure cod**e at **high velocity** while **minimizing potential risk**s.
- Often teams can't scale due to people resources as bottlenecks. DevOps teams **build automation** where appropriate to **eliminate human intervention** and chances of human errors.
- In the DevOps world, there is **no business vs IT**. It's all business. Teams work towards the **common goal** of planning and delivering business features.
- Since business and IT are working together to plan and deliver features, there are **no more shortcuts by IT** and as a result no or much less technical debt.

## Ease of implementing DevOps in the Cloud

- **API driven**: Cloud infrastructure and services are driven by Application Programming Interfaces (API). This allows the DevOps team to build an automation framework easily provisioning infrastructure and application resources programmatically.
- **CI/CD services**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment services are natively provided by cloud providers. For instance, Azure provides Azure DevOps. AWS provides services such as AWS Codepipeline, AWS Codebuild, or AWS CodeDeploy.
- **Cloud elasticity benefits**: Cloud's elastic properties allow you to do multiple types of deployment models cost-effectively such as the Blue/Green deployment we discussed earlier. Cloud also makes it easy to programmatically clone a production environment for staging or testing.
- **Governance**: Cloud provides lots of controls and observability features that make Governance easier. CSPs provide fine-grain usage and cost reporting allowing you to track and manage your project's development and deployment costs.

# Exercise: Customer Service Response Time

## Addressing customer service response time

### Exercise 2

Assume you head a newly created CCoE for your organization. Your organization wants to improve the response time to customer needs. Your existing organization methodology is waterfall-driven. What specific steps would you take to transform your organization to improve the response time to customers? Name at least 3 steps and rationalize the expected outcome.

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.


# Solution Exercise 2

## Sample Solution

I’d take the following steps:

1. Recruit a cross-functional team to join CCOE by handpicking candidates who could be change agents, have a growth mindset, and are not afraid to fail. The team would be small ~6 people
2. Pick a small project (e.g. building a new app) and deliver it quickly on the cloud using DevOps model and tooling from the cloud provider (e.g. Infrastructure as code, CI/CD automation)
3. From this project, create a reference architecture, tooling, and other re-usable assets for the cloud that can be shared with other teams
4. Evangelize the outcome and benefits. Get leadership support to spread the message.
5. Organize DevOps education brown bags, share experiences and act as mentors for other teams. As more teams onboard to cloud and DevOps, keep adding to the re-usable assets
# FinOps

## What is FinOps?

- Also known as **Cloud Financial Managemen**t, it is a new cultural practice where finance, procurement, engineering collaborate to manage cloud spend.
- It's a new process - unlike the on-prem model where finance and procurement would negotiate with vendors and procure assets for use by engineering, in the cloud world engineering is procuring assets and spending the company's money when they spin up resources in the cloud.

## Why is FinOps needed?

- If you want to **get the best value** from your cloud spend, you need to adopt new practices and make changes to your operating models. Otherwise, You run the risk of cost overruns and wasted spend if the FinOps practices and controls are not put in place.
- When costs get out of control, it is hard to **drive accountability** across teams. FinOps practices help you with this.
- Every business makes a **tradeoff between speed, cost, and quality** with the limited money it has. FinOps helps you achieve the right balance.

## Phases of FinOps

There are 3 main phases of FinOps:

- **Inform**
    - FinOps teams start with data and look at the spend by department, BU, project, whether it is Dev, Test or Prod, etc. They also look for anomalies in the data to identify opportunities for savings. For instance, if a particular cloud SKU is showing lower utilization, perhaps it can be substituted with a lower SKU, a process called rightsizing.
- **Optimize**
    - Based on the data from Inform phase, the team would identify opportunities such as the one we mentioned with rightsizing. Financial goals are set and the team looks at ways to optimize spend to reach the goals.
- **Operate**
    - While some of the financial goals can be easily accomplished, others may require slightly longer processes. For instance, if the application requires architecture changes to minimize spend, it may take some time. The team would identity and execute processes to reach the financial goals.

## Team structure and relationship with FinOps

![FinOps Team Structures](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/603e451f_finsops-structure-teams/finsops-structure-teams.png)

FinOps Team Structures

As you can see in the above image, the FinOps team is cross-functional and mainly consists of 4 main teams

- **Engineering teams** are generally not trained to factor in cost along with other design goals such as performance, scalability, reliability, etc, that they have practiced for years. However, they are the ones who are making spend decisions as they deploy infrastructure and provision services in the cloud.
- **Business or Product owners** care about product costs and margins and can help the team make the right tradeoff calls between speed, cost, and quality.
- **Executive** sponsorship is essential to drive a cost-conscious culture in the organization as well as ensuring resourcing of the FinOps team.
- **Finance** can help by looking at the designs from a cost angle and work with engineering to make appropriate tradeoffs. Finance can also look at the cloud services usage data and identify opportunities for optimization. Procurement can consolidate the needs of engineering teams and negotiate cloud contracts with CSPs.
# Exercise: KPIs for Teams

## Team KPIs

Assume you are the CFO of your company and the executive sponsor for CCoE. Briefly describe that business to provide context for your responses. _Reminder: KPIs are measurable strategies that help businesses evaluate how effectively they’re meeting operational and strategic goals._ What business (K)ey (P)performance (I)ndicators would you create for each of your teams building on the cloud? Also in your response (**for each team)** how would you drive accountabilities and awareness so teams can take appropriate actions to improve the business KPIs?

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

# Solution Exercise 3

## Sample Solution

I am the CFO of a ride-sharing company called RideWithUs. We provide 7 ride-sharing services for different classes of transportation ranging from scooters to black cars. There are 2 teams that build the common foundational services powering all of our service offerings while each service team is responsible for their own service built on top of common foundational services.

Business KPIs (Cost implies Cloud cost) for one such service X:

1. Cost per thousand rides of Service X
2. Foundational Service A cost per thousand rides of Service X
3. Foundational Service B cost per thousand rides of Service X

To drive accountabilities and awareness with specific goals, I’ll ensure that cloud-spend data is broken down to a fine grain level (utilizing resource tagging by departments, BUs, project teams, etc.) and custom reporting is available to each team to track/manage their individual costs. Further, I’ll create cost optimization KPIs for teams:

1. Reserved Instance utilization - target 90% (currently at 75%)
2. Right Sizing recommendations compliance - target 80% (currently 60%)

# Best Practice and Expert Intuition

![Best Practice and expert tips](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/July/60dde46d_tips/tips.png)

Best Practice and expert tips

## Executive Sponsorship

Experience has shown that organizations adopt cloud faster when there is a strong executive champion.

- The C-level sponsor needs to have a great understanding of the cloud and its benefits. It's a big change so the person needs to be empathetic as a top-down command and control approach won't work. The person's needs are involved, address any or all questions that may come up, and be able to get commitments behind the decisions made by him or her. Informal surveys of rank and file have reported a lack of executive understanding and appreciation of work involved to move to the cloud.
- The person needs to set a bold direction or goals and support people to realize the goal. As an example, a few years ago CIO of General Electric or GE set a goal for moving 50 apps to the cloud in 30 days. It seemed aggressive and unachievable. Eventually, the team moved 42 apps in 30 days but used the learnings to move 2000+ apps over the next 3 years.

## CCoE

- **Leader selection**
    - If you recall, CCOE is the center of the universe for all things cloud. Pick a CCOE leader who has strong EQ and people skills. The leader should be aware of the people, process, and cultural aspects of the change he/she is going to drive. If you recall, the CCOE leader interfaces with all BU heads and multiple functional organizations. Getting buy-in and commitment from all these organizations is a hard job given conflicting priorities. Typical roles leading CCOE could be CIO, one of CIO directs, Enterprise Architect, Leader of Program Management.
- **Member selection**
    - Pick members carefully - the most senior or qualified people aren’t necessarily the best choices. You need people who are hungry for new things, are go-getters, can try out different things and are not afraid to fail. They are change agents and command respect in their respective organizations for these skills. As you saw earlier, CCOE covers a variety of business and technical functions. Typically I have seen members join from infrastructure, operations, applications, finance, procurement, infosec, and program management organizations.

## DevOps culture

- **Start small and scale**
    - Changing your operating model and embracing DevOps culture is not a switch flip. You need to carefully plan it and slowly drive this from the ground up. I have seen this work in organizations where they pick a new workload and handpick a cross-functional team to work on it. The team will build practices and tools to optimize the delivery velocity and can deliver reusable automation and tooling for use by other teams.
- **Emphasize teamwork and collaboration**
    - You may also want to consider infusing other teams with members of this team to jumpstart DevOps philosophies. Remember to emphasize more teamwork and collaboration than on practices and tooling. DevOps at its core is a culture and mindset change.

## FinOps

- **Find an engineering savvy finance analyst**
    - A finance person with an engineering background or inclination could be an excellent fit on this team. He or she can gel well with the engineering team and significantly reduce the cost management burden from engineering teams who have to focus on delivering features.
- **Drive a cost-conscious culture**
    - Cost consciousness needs to be driven as a cultural practice across the organization. One way to do that is to - _Have the teams build and publish KPIs and score their own performance against them_. For instance, ride-sharing company Lyft started with a simple metric - cloud cost per ride as a start to bring cost awareness. Over time, they translated this simple metric to metrics for individual teams so each team can benchmark their own performance against other teams. This helped drive cost-consciousness in engineering ranks.
    - Another important point to remember - FinOps is not about cost reduction. it's about utilizing your cloud spend effectively to maximize business outcomes. If your spending is increasing commensurate with your business growth, it's a good thing.

## Tips and Advice for Success

- **Don't work incrementally. Make big bets**
    - Doing incremental work on the cloud isn't effective, you need to make big bets on the cloud to move fast. Recall the GE CIO example where she set an aggressive goal of moving 50 apps to the cloud in 30 days. Just dipping the toe in the water doesn't lead to any meaningful results for the business.
- **Be aware of 'frozen middle'**
    - The 'frozen middle' refers to middle management who become risk-averse over time and tend to slow down things. Handling the situation through rewards, recognition, and other motivational ways would line them up to support you.
- **Face inertia and resistance with reasoning and sincerity**
    - Changes are not easy to drive especially when the magnitude of the change is big impacting culture, processes, people, and technology. Don't resort to command and control leadership. Face the inertia and resistance on its face with reasoning and sincerity. This would require you to learn about the cloud as much as you can and to dive deep.
- **Trust your intuition**
    - Trust your intuition when faced with convincing data people will produce in support of their arguments. In one of my past experiences, I was shown data to show it is more cost-effective to run on-premises, and also there is a higher level of security risk when developers make a mistake in the cloud. I addressed the situation by diving deep and coming up with solutions to address the issues. We will discuss in the next chapter how a cloud governance model can mitigate the security risks in the cloud without compromising agility.

# 4. Cloud Governance Model
# Cost Governance

**On-Prem**

- Capex, capital expenditures on a yearly basis
- Yearly budget and procuring hardware and software licenses (fixed)
- Finance and Procurement have full spend control

**Cloud**

- Opex, operational expenditures as needed to run business
- Dynamic spend as cloud resources are spun (variable)
- Engineering gets control

## Governance gives you a handle on cloud costs

Engineering traditionally has not been trained for this model; it is common to leave resources running even when not in use, which will incur charges.

If you don’t put governance, you’ll likely end up with runaway cloud costs. Finance and procurement still have a role but _now need to collaborate with engineering to ensure the optimal usage of company spend._

This is a new mindset for many organizations.

## Cost factors

![Cost Factors](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6042b913_cost-facotrs/cost-facotrs.png)

Cost Factors

Here are some major cost factors that impact your spending.

- **Idle Resources**
    - We talked about engineering getting control of procuring resources. Unfortunately, On-prem SDLC habits carried to the cloud would incur wastage. E.g. developers leaving the dev/test resources running in the evenings and weekends cost $ on the cloud. You can implement a tool or automation in your cloud environment to shut down idle resources
- **On-demand instances**
    - On-demand instances are the most expensive. Cloud providers allow you to pre-buy capacity at a significant discount. For instance, AWS offers Reserved Instances and Savings Plan. Once you pre-buy capacity, you use it or lose it. So the challenge is how do you estimate how much to buy? One of the ways you can estimate it is by looking at historical usage and collecting forecasted usage from your teams. Once you pre-buy, your cost governance model should aim to drive high utilization of this capacity.
- **Rightsizing**
    - There is also a tendency among developers to use the largest resource size (more expensive) when a smaller resource size (less expensive) can do the job. Not that they want to waste the company's money but lack of data may lead them to make wrong choices. You can implement a tool or automation to collect data from cloud resource usage and utilize this data to make sizing decisions. The process is called Rightsizing.
- **Spot Instance**
    - Spot instances are the excess capacity cloud providers have that they offer in the spot market at a steep discount. However, spot instances can be taken away programmatically with a 2 min warning. This requires architecture changes to accommodate this interruption and may not work for all types of workloads. Another cloud innovation is Serverless services where you don't need to spin up instances and pay for, only the time when your code runs. Serverless also requires architectural changes to your apps. You need to educate your teams and see if there are opportunities to utilize spot instances or Serverless.

## Where to Start

![Teams and the Cloud](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6042bb76_teams/teams.png)

Teams and the Cloud

This is an important point that business leaders typically ignore. And that is the need to train all your teams with targeted cloud education. In the image above, you can see this represented.

- **Engineering** - _Cloud Economics_
    - Engineering teams are used to optimize for performance, reliability, scalability, etc but are not used to think about the cost since the cost was never a consideration in the on-prem world.
- **Finance** - _Cloud Technology_
    - Finance teams need to understand cloud technology terms and cost factors so they can team up with engineering to optimize spend.
- **Procurement** - _Cloud Agreements_
    - Cloud agreements are very different in nature than hardware and software licensing agreements so unless the procurement team is also aware of cloud basics, they won't be able to structure the agreements in the best interest of your organization.

`Assess the skill gaps and address them first, before you start addressing tech and process gaps with a cloud spend governance model.`

## Framework for cloud spend governance

Once you have addressed the skills gap, you are now ready to put a governance model for your organization.

![Framework for cloud spend governance](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6042bbee_framework-for-cloud-governa/framework-for-cloud-governa.png)

Framework for cloud spend governance

Think back to the **FinOps** team structure from an earlier lesson. That would be a perfect place to start defining the governance model. Alternatively, a subteam within **CCOE** consisting of finance, procurement, and engineering can also be chartered to do the same. in the image above, you can see both represented in the center of the diagram, with several elements of the framework connected to them

- **Monitor spend, usage, and forecast**
    - The first step is to ensure you have a good cloud spend measurement system in place. This can be accomplished by implementing a tool or buying a third-party tool that would help you with spend usage, allocation, forecasts, and showback/chargeback across departments.
- **Negotiate enterprise discounts**
    - Once you have the usage data and 3-year spend forecast, use it to negotiate an enterprise discount with your cloud vendors. Set up your CCoE (Cloud Center of Excellence) and forecast cloud spend for 3 years. Stakeholders: Finance, Procurement, Eng
- **Allocate spend budgets by Department/BU**
    - Next, allocate the spending budgets across departments. The tool you implemented should help you with allocation, reporting as well as monitoring of spend against the budgets and can alert you when spends are trending to go over budget.
- **Implement spend policies and controls**
    - Ensure your organization policies and controls are implemented in your cloud environments through automation so you can manage spends on a continuous basis throughout the year, and get alerts/notifications, etc when actuals are trending to exceed budgets. For instance, You may want to implement controls in CI/CD to prevent developers from spinning up expensive SKUs in the developer environment.
- **Publish business KPIs and reward systems**
    - Build a cost-conscious culture, you can publish business KPIs and encourage teams to drive continuous improvements. You may also consider rewarding teams who take special measures to drive the KPIs.
    - **Example**: For instance, Lyft, a well-known rideshare company started with cloud cost per ride as a simple KPI and later defined fine-grain KPIs to make them relevant to individual teams.
# Exercise: Cost Management

## Cost Management

Assume you are the CIO of a company that is on its journey to the cloud with a cloud service provider(CSP). You review monthly invoices from your CSP and notice the bill is rising 20% month over month. What steps would you take? Include at least 4 or 5 possible steps.

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.


# Solution Exercise 1

## Sample Solution

Proposed Steps:

- Setup CCOE (if not already there) and charter them to define policies and controls to optimize spend.
- Analyze the usage data by BU/Dept/projects and usage type (Dev/Test/Prod). If the usage data is not available, implement a cost management tool to get fine-grained spending reporting.
- Check for wasted resources by examining data. E.g. Resources tagged as Dev for Project A incurring charges over weekends. Ask Operations to implement tools/automation to shut them down when not in use.
- Ask the teams if they have gone through an exercise of right-sizing instances using data provided by the tool.
- Identify opportunities to pre-buy capacity based on usage data from the tool.
- Ask teams if they can make architectural changes to use spot capacity (e.g. spot instances(AWS), Spot VMs (Azure), Preemptible VMs (Google)), and serverless architectures.
- Publish business KPIs and align team rewards with business KPIs

# Security Governance

![Shared Responsibility Model](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/604a4fa1_shared-resp/shared-resp.png)

Shared Responsibility Model

## Security responsibilities in the cloud

In the first lesson, we discussed the differences between on-prem, IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in terms of who manages what components of the technology stack. The same model applies for managing security where "_security of the cloud_" is cloud providers' responsibility but "_security in the cloud_" is yours.

- There are some clear areas of security ownership such as applications, data, devices, cloud accounts and identities belong to the **customer(you)**.
- However, there are some grey areas in the **middle** where you need to dive into details of the services you use from your cloud provider and make sure you are carrying out your part of the responsibility.
- All **cloud providers** take a lot of security headaches away from you. They also provide you security-related services that you can use to do your part and secure the entire application stack.

## Security governance is a 3 layer model

![3-Layered Security Model](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/604910a4_3layers/3layers.png)

3-Layered Security Model

The graphic at the topic of the page goes into granular detail about what exactly is and is not provided. In a more simplified model, the best way to think of security governance is a **3 layer model**

- **Infrastructure security** is owned by the **cloud provider**. This includes securing compute, storage, and network resources. However remember the configuration of these resources is still owned by you and if not configured properly, can lead to potential security exposures.
- **Application security** is entirely owned by **you**. This includes application-specific security controls and data classification. We earlier talked about DevSecOps as a culture that fundamentally resides in this layer. This layer is supported by
- **Platform Security** as the middle layer, if done right can make things much simpler for DevOps teams. This layer includes foundational controls such as identity and access management, logging, auditing, automated response, and remediation. If you recall CCOE functions, this is one of the areas where CCOE can help by providing code, templates, tooling, and other assets. The more we can abstract from application teams in terms of foundational controls as well as common patterns we see across applications, the faster the application teams move. This middle layer is typically owned by the central cloud engineering team.

## Security is everyone's responsibility

Security governance isn't just a set of technologies and frameworks. While frameworks such as CIS benchmarks, NIST CSF, etc. are great to implement these frameworks alone won't help you achieve your security objectives.

You should think of security governance through the lens of your

- People
- Process
- Technology

A culture of "Security is everyone's responsibility" goes a long way in establishing good security governance.

### Role of InfoSec professionals

This role needs to evolve from being a gatekeeper to an enabler of the business where they provide automated controls and policies, work with developers to implement automated response and remediation of security incidents. They have a key role to play in CCoE to accomplish these objectives. This is the only way for Infosec to scale and ensure robust security governance.

# Exercise: Security Checks and Guardrails

## Security Checks and Guardrails

If you have a CI/CD pipeline in place for your cloud projects, find out what type of security checks are done in the pipeline. Additionally, describe any security guardrails that are in place.

If you don’t have a pipeline in your organization, how would you design a CI/CD pipeline with proper security checks and guardrails? List and describe specific security checks and guardrails you’d consider _(e.g. for containerized environments you may want to scan all container images through a tool)_

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

# Solution Exercise 2

## Sample Solution 2

I’d design the pipeline with the following automated checks:

1. Security configuration checks (all application component configurations e.g. app, web server, DB, etc against guidelines from CIS, OWASP, etc.
2. Static code analysis
3. Dynamic Code analysis
4. Security assurance to confirm all high priority security issues have been addressed in the current build before moving to deployment
5. Threat modeling done
6. Penetration Testing completed
7. Security compliance checks passed
8. Scan container images for malware

Guardrails:

- A comprehensive set of guardrails can be implemented with help from the security team, but here are a few common ones:
- Prevent storage bucket public access - by automatically making it private or warning user when he accidentally creates a bucket with public access
- Secret keys in code - warn users and ask them to put secrets in vaults provided by cloud provider
- Configuration changes - e.g. changed security group settings that may open up internet ingress
# Compliance Governance

As discussed in the video and also demonstrated in the image below, it useful for us to understand the big picture of how Governance, Risk Management, and compliance are related.

### What is required to meet your compliance requirements in the cloud?

- **Risk**
    - Every organization has risks such as financial, legal, reputation, or cybersecurity-related.
    - Risk management function provides the risk parameters to the governance function that needs to ensure that policies, controls, and processes are designed and implemented to operate within risk boundaries.
- **Compliance**
    - Compliance function ensures that external and internal standards are adhered to. These could be industry regulations such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, or Hitrust. These could also be your own organizational standards or policies that may have been designed to mitigate risks or align with your business objectives. These standards or policies typically come from risk management functions.
- **Governance**
    - The compliance function needs support from governance to continuously monitor compliance and report or act on compliance violations for both externally or internally defined standards and policies.

![Governance, Compliance, and Risk](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6042af79_gover/gover.png)

Governance, Compliance, and Risk

---

## Guardrails

Guardrails are simply preconfigured rules for

- Security
- Compliance
- Cost management

### Preventive and Detective Guardrails

![Guardrails](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6049120f_sec-comp-guard/sec-comp-guard.png)

Preventive and Detective Guardrails

They can be applied to any hierarchical level in the organization. You can see in the image above what this looks like:

- **Preventive guardrails**
    - Preventive guardrails are configured to enforce and prevent any violation. They disallow actions that could lead to a policy violation. For instance, if you don't want any storage bucket to be exposed to the public read access on Internet, you can disallow the creation of a storage bucket unless proper protection is on. Another example - to manage cost better, you may have a guardrail that may disallow the creation of certain types of compute instances, since they are expensive, in developer accounts.
- **Detective guardrails**
    - Detective guardrails are configured to detect the violations and report them in a dashboard or other mechanisms. You may have a detective guardrail that senses non-compliant behavior in resource configurations and report it. For instance, you may have a list of prohibited applications for which you may want to create a detective guardrail to detect if any application from that list gets installed. Upon detection, you may report it in the dashboard and also take an action to shut down the compute instance on which the application got installed.

CSPs provide mechanisms to create preventive and detective guardrails. There are many third-party and open source products that make it easier to manage compliance extending the native capabilities of the CSP.


# Governance at Enterprise Scale

## Enterprise-scale adoption

### Cost Management

Cost Management requires a different approach. In the OPEX-driven model, Your engineering teams are taking the role of procurement and finance when they spin up resources in the cloud.

- Because the cloud is code and API-driven, you need mechanisms to manage and optimize cost without putting barriers on developers' agility.
- Manual processes simply won't work with hundreds or thousands of developers in your company.

### Security and Compliance

- The shared responsibility model may cause confusion around grey areas leaving you exposed.
- Your developers far outnumber the Infosec staff you have.
- Manual security check processes would kill developer agility.
- Manual processes don't scale well and are error-prone.

Cloud Service Providers understand these challenges and provide technical solutions to design and customize a governance model.

## Scale Challenges

As more teams start building on the cloud, teams need to be responsible for managing their own resources.

### Challenges to scaling operations into the cloud

- **Resource isolation**: Businesses have to make sure different users, business units and project teams are not impacting each other. They need their own resource containers to keep them isolated from others. This can be done through separate cloud accounts or subscriptions. But managing the growing number of accounts or subscriptions becomes challenging unless there is a way to organize them.
- **Cost Management**: Each business unit or project team may have a budget that needs to map to cloud accounts or subscriptions they own. Managing cost allocation, reporting and ensuring teams don't exceed the budgets becomes a challenge very quickly in organizations that are growing on the cloud.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensuring security and compliance of these accounts and subscriptions when you have limited security and compliance professionals but more developers become challenging. Manual methods don't scale.
- **Account provisioning**: As new account or subscription requests come in, how do you make sure they come equipped with proper security, compliance, and cost management guardrails? Manual methods would be error-prone and won't be able to scale.

---

## Landing Zones

### What is a Landing Zone?

- **Pre-configured cloud environment**: Landing Zone is a way to organize and manage your cloud accounts. You can organize all of your cloud accounts in a hierarchy and configure controls and policies at any level - organization-wide, by business unit, departments, or projects. This makes sure that the accounts under a particular hierarchical level have controls and policies prescribed for that hierarchical level. For instance, a department that deals with personally identifiable data may want to enforce PCI DSS controls for all accounts in that department.
    
- **AWS accounts, Azure subscriptions, GCP projects**: All cloud providers provide mechanisms to create a landing zone where you can pre-configure accounts with your organizational policies, guardrails, security and compliance reporting tools, etc. Each cloud provider uses different terms for accounts that are nothing but isolated resource containers. AWS calls them accounts, Azure calls them subscriptions, GCP calls them projects. In essence, they all act as isolated resource containers.
    

### What does a Landing Zone deliver?

- **Resource isolation**: By organizing accounts in a hierarchy you can accomplish isolation at any level such as project, department, BU, etc. This drives accountability to each of these organizational units.
- **Cost management**: By allocating budgets to any organizational unit, you can ensure all accounts under that organization unit stay within the budget limits. We will see how this works later.
- **Security and compliance**: Each account comes pre-provisioned with security, compliance, and other organizational policies so your developers can be productive from the instant the account is provisioned.
- **Account provisioning**: Account provisioning can be completed automated as well. Once an account creation request is approved, landing zone automation will pre-configure the account with appropriate guardrails and disburse it to the requester almost immediately.

![Landing Zone typical setup](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6049130e_landing-zone/landing-zone.png)

Landing Zone typical setup

The image above represents a typical setup of a landing zone in large organizations. This setup is described below.

## Landing Zone typical setup

### Business unit IT

Business OUs and Sandbox OUs are typically managed by business unit IT owners. In some cases, I have to see Sandbox OU being assigned to a central cloud engineering organization.

### Foundational OU

Since the Landing zone allows you to organize accounts in a hierarchy, you may want to create a foundational OU or organizational unit that will serve all business units. You can see this in the center of the image above, in the foundational OU, you may have accounts with security-related functions such as logging, auditing, forensics, and another security tooling. This gives visibility and control to InfoSec professionals across all accounts in the organization.

- You may also run some shared infrastructure services such as network configurations for all accounts.
- Security accounts have controlled access to Infosec professionals
- Similarly Shared services accounts are typically managed by central cloud engineering organizations.

### Business Units OU

Business Units OUs get set up over the foundational OUs. Each BU may have differing security or compliance requirements. However, this mechanism allows BUs to be different yet inherit common foundational security and compliance controls.

### Sandbox OU

We earlier talked about Sandbox accounts. They also come pre-provisioned with the right cost and security controls.

## Governance in Action

As you can see in the image below, **Security** and **Compliance** guardrails flow down through the hierarchy, as do the **budgets**. For instance, you may assign _$500K_ to Operations and $_300K_ to engineering, leaving $_200K_ to HR. The guardrails system would warn if any cost bucket is running too hot and likely to exceed budge.

## Example

![Governance in Action](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60491382_gov-in-act1/gov-in-act1.png)

Governance in Action Flow of guardrails and budgets

## Exceeding budget scenario

Imagine that **Project 3 by team B** exceeds the budget. The guardrails system would warn if any cost bucket is running too hot and likely to exceed budget, which has an impact on **Engineering** as well as **Operations** as a whole.

In the image below, you can see the effect on multiple organizational levels as the Project 3 cost overrun flows back up(red).

You may want to put a guardrail to restrict or throttle the creation of new resources in this situation. Just like security and compliance guardrails, the cost management guardrail can be put at any organizational level.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6049138a_goc-in-act2/goc-in-act2.png)

Governance in Action guardrails can control budget overuns

## Automate

The cloud is that it allows you to automate a big chunk of your governance model. So for example,

- **Spend Governance**: If the spend is likely to exceed the assigned budget in an account, automation can alert the account owner so he or she can take appropriate actions to stay within budget. You can even put preventive automation that restricts engineers from spinning up expensive resources in the CI/CD pipeline itself.
- **Security Governance**: You can put preventive automation for security too in the CI/CD pipeline, which will prevent insecure code to get deployed. Automation can also be used for not only detecting anomalous activities but also responding to them with a user-defined action or set of actions.
- **Compliance Governance**: Many compliance rules can be automated so any deviance from compliance guardrails can be flagged and appropriate actions are taken to bring the system back on track. For instance, HIPAA has many privacy and security rules that can be automated to keep your systems HIPAA compliant continuously.

Developers who are not financially savvy, or have the security of compliance expertise can _freely innovate_ knowing the system would always keep them within the guardrails. Finance, security, and compliance professionals aren't running around conducting reviews and audits because they can now trust the automation will take care of it.

## Mechanisms to help with Governance

There are many powerful mechanisms and tools provided by your CSP in the cloud to help you build automation for practically any use case.

### Tagging:

Tag is a metadata for a cloud resource. You can use tagging for multiple use cases. For instance, you can tag resources for a nightly backup. Tags can also be associated with projects or departments for proper cost allocation. Tags also allow you to create fine-grain access control policies for security and compliance.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM:

Cloud providers provide their own IAM system that can be used to define identities and control access to cloud resources. You can use tagging to build IAM policies to provide attribute-based access controls. For instance, you can build a policy that allows user A to administer only those organizations units that have a tag X.

### Configuration Management:

Services such as AWS Config or Azure policies allow you to detect changes to your configuration. They can be used for many purposes including auditing and compliance. For instance, you can specify a rule as a detective guardrail that the service can flag, such as ports being open on an instance, allowing you to take any action on the resource to bring your system back on track.

### Policies:

Mechanisms such as AWS Service Control Policies and Azure Policies allow you to apply organization-wide guardrails. For instance, you can define a policy to disallow resource creation in certain regions.

### Logging and Monitoring

Logging and Monitoring services such as AWS Cloudtrail, AWS Cloudwatch, Azure Monitor, Azure Application Insights allow you to record events for security incident management and forensics and monitor your environment for anomalous activities.

### Serverless Services

Serverless Services are services such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions that allow you to write your own rules in response to events. You can use them to implement an organizational policy. For instance, if the event is related to a configuration change on a resource you can write a rule to either shut down the resource or quarantine it.

### CSP Native services

CSPs also provide many services for cost management, security, and compliance that you may want to use out of the box or build upon them. For instance, AWS Trusted Advisor or Azure Advisor provide a thorough analysis of your environment to help you improve security posture and find cost optimization opportunities.


# Exercise: Workflows, Costs, Accounts, & Security

## Workflows

Oftentimes, when a new user requests a new account(e.g. AWS or Azure, Google, or IBM), it can come with a budget envelope of $2000(or some amount). There may be warnings or throttles as you reach that limit. This is the equivalent to an enterprise providing a debit card to its employee with $2000 in it.

Does your organization have a self-service portal to request/open a new cloud account? If yes, investigate and list the workflow steps operating behind the scenes that put cost boundaries, provisions security guardrails, and ensure compliance of the account. List the specifics to the extent you can discover them (e.g. each account under $2000 is automatically provisioned else goes to manager approval).

If you don’t have one, how would you go about designing one? List specific workflow steps you’d consider putting in prior to provisioning new accounts.

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

## Solution

- Provide a list of account types for users to pick from. If the account type picked is of type “Sandbox”, immediately provision it with required policies and guardrails and time/budget limits. Developer can start using it right away
- For non-sandbox accounts, review the requested budget and purpose. If it exceeds automatic approval limits set by the BU head, send it to the manager’s approval.
- Upon approval, do the following:
    - Create a baseline architecture in the account, configure Identity and Access Management policies, drop pre-defined service configurations such as VPC, code repositories, security tools, storage buckets, etc.
    - Associate the account with the GRC tool so the account can be monitored for compliance
- Enable cost monitoring so as to warn users when account limits are closed.
- Make the account available for use.
# Best Practice and Expert Intuition

- **Automate everything**
    
    - The beauty of the cloud is the power of API and 100+ services at your disposal to automate anything. Automation allows you to
        - scale
        - reduce human errors
        - drives agility.
    - Many organizations such as Netflix, Amazon, CapitalOne, GE Appliances have built the automation we discussed to run cost management, security, and compliance on auto-pilot allowing their teams to innovate fast while keeping them secure and compliant.
- **Don't forget people, process, and culture**
    
    - Good governance is not just technology and automation. Its also the people, process, and culture that plays a key role in defining and implementing a governance model. For instance, cost governance without a cost-conscious culture would lead to sub-optimal business outcomes.
    - **Example**: Lyft, the ride-sharing company, came up with creative ways to publish the cloud cost numbers individualized by teams to create awareness. This resulted in a desire to improve when team managers saw other teams doing better than them.
- **Get away from IT governance mindset**
    
    - IT governance in traditional IT organizations is gated by people, tickets, manual approvals, etc slowing things down. Cloud changes the model completely. You put your organizational policies and processes as code in the environment using cloud services and eliminating humans and manual actions from the mix. Net result - you move fast.
- **Focus on CCoE**
    
    - Constituting your CCoE with the right leader and members is very important as I discussed in the previous lesson. In addition to being the cloud champion for the organization, CCOE helps you build and implement the right governance model. From my own experience in working with a large enterprise, I saw little progress when the CCOE leader wasn't a good fit for the role. A leadership change was made after several months, and things began to improve significantly.
- **Governance is dynamic**
    
    - Governance is never one and done. Your organizational context keeps changing including the markets, customer needs, business priorities. Accordingly, your governance model should keep evolving to maximize alignment with the business objectives while minimizing risks. Remember governance exists to serve the business not restrict it. The best part is - it's all in software so can be changed easily. Your employees feel good that they don't have to worry about things that are beyond their competencies.

# 4. Cloud Innovation and Futures

## Lesson Overview

The key reason people move to the cloud is for business agility and driving innovation in the cloud. In this lesson, we will look at some of the capabilities of the cloud that you can utilize to drive business innovation.

- We will start by looking at some business trends and see how the increased pace of innovation is driving disruption in all industries. Needless to say, you need to increase your own pace of innovation to avoid getting displaced or disrupted.
- We will discuss how some of the characteristics of cloud are well suited for innovation
- We will look at some of the major cloud services that are being utilized to drive innovation. We will also cover some typical use cases across all industry segments that are apt for these cloud services

Some of these innovations are shown below and will be the focus of this lesson

### Changing landscape of S&P 500 companies

By 2027, the average company will last just 12 years on the S&P 500, according to Innosight’s biennial corporate longevity forecast. In the image above, notice the area highlighted in black; at the current and forecasted turnover rate, the Innosight study shows that nearly 50% of the current S&P 500 will be replaced over the next ten years.

![Rise of tech companies](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6051f43a_rise/rise.png)

Rise of tech companies

What these top 4 firms all have in common are powerful digital platforms that provide the scale and scope to expand into new growth markets and geographies at speeds never before possible.

What does this tell us? The impact that technology platforms have on consumers as well as enterprise businesses.

`All companies are becoming technology companies!`

### Software is eating the world

Marc Andreesen(Wallstreet Journal) rightly said - Software is eating the world.

- The **music** industry is ruled by the likes of _Apple iTunes, Spotify, Pandora_.
- The **video** service industry is led by _Netflix_ and _Amazon_ prime video
- The largest **bookseller** Amazon is a software company that has even digitized books through Kindle.
- **Photography** is all digital and software-driven.
- **Movie** production company _Pixar_ was a software company bought by _Disney_ to stay relevant.
- **Transportation** companies _Uber_ and _Lyft_, both of them also really technology companies, complete more rides than all taxi companies in the US combined without owning a single taxi.
- **Vacation rental** company _Airbnb_ provisions more rooms per day than the 100-year-old Hilton chain.

Whatever business you are in ...whether it is Healthcare. Media and Entertainment, Retail, Industrial and Manufacturing, Mining, Agricultural or something else - you need to go digital and you need to innovate to stay on top or risk disruption.

Cloud gives you the digital platform to innovate.

### Why innovate in the cloud?

There are certain characteristics of the cloud that make it an appropriate platform for innovation

- **Global reach:** Innovation requires experimentation. Conducting experimentation in a certain geographic market won't be easy if you need to acquire resources in that region. With the cloud, you can pick a region or multiple regions and run your experiments programmatically.
- **Low cost of experimentation**: Your experiments are time-bound and may run for a few weeks or months. If they succeed great, but if they don't you can shut them down and owe nothing. This way you can fail fast, a key attribute of rapid innovation.
- **Speed of Provisioning**: If your experiment succeeds in the test market, you can quickly expand into other markets utilizing the global presence of cloud providers. Since everything is code and API-driven and you have access to a virtually unlimited pool of resources, the speed of provisioning gives you a significant advantage in the cloud.
- **Access to a variety of resources**: Cloud providers offer a variety of computing, storage, network, and higher-value services. The variety of resources you may need access to at the same time would have been difficult to acquire to conduct a timely experiment.

**Example**: If your experiment requires AI and Machine learning that's best done using the latest GPUs, a special type of processor, is readily available on the cloud along with other resources. The GPUs would have been difficult to acquire otherwise.

# Cloud Innovation Services

## Leading-edge innovation tools

There are numerous major service areas and domains where cloud providers continue to innovate to provide you the best services to help you innovate in your business faster.

For each of these topics, we will dive deeper and see what it is, how it can potentially deliver strategic value to you, and take a look at typical use cases across multiple industries.

- Serverless computing
- Containers
- Data Lake and Analytics
- Internet of Things(I.O.T.)
- AI and M.L.
- Blockchain as a service
- Edge computing
# Serverless

- No-server management. Provisioning, patching, and all I.T.-related activity of computing is handled by the CSP.
- Scaling is automatic
- Built-in fault tolerance

## Pay for Value vs. Pay for Use

One of the most valuable elements of serverless computing is something called Pay for Value

- **Pay-for-value**: No resource needs to be provisioned by you so there is no risk of wasted money due to idling or underutilization of resources. In the pay-for-value model, you upload your application to the cloud and only pay for the time when your application runs. You don't own compute instance so are not liable for paying for it.
- **Pay-for-use**: If you spin up a compute instance in the cloud for running your application. You are paying for computing instances by the minute regardless of whether your application is running or not. This is because the compute instance is yours until you shut it down.

## Real-World Examples

- **Function as a Service**
    - e.g _AWS Lambda or Azure Functions_
    - Compute services where you upload only your application code and pay for only the time when the code runs.
- **Datastores**
    - e.g _Amazon DynamoDB, or Azure SQL DB serverless_
    - Data Stores don't need any maintenance such as scaling, backup, recovery, etc, from you.
- **Application integration services**
    - e.g. _AWS API gateway or Azure API gateway_
    - App integration services allow you to focus on developing your app components and connect the components using app integration services. For instance, you can configure API Gateway to connect the client to the backend through APIs reducing a huge burden on developers

## Use Cases

Now that you understand the basic concept of Serverless, let's look at how different industries are using Serverless Computing.

- **Web applications** that can scale up and down with traffic are ideal for serverless. No need to fear crashing with sudden surges of traffic.
- Serverless computing is **event-driven a**nd can be triggered from a variety of triggers such as pub/subtopics, upload of a new object in storage, event logs, etc. These event streaming pipelines can be used in multiple ways without explicitly provisioning and de-provisioning infrastructure
- A simple example of **media processing** is the generation of a thumbnail using a serverless function when a new image is uploaded to a storage bucket in the cloud. An event is generated automatically with a new image upload that invokes the thumbnail generating logic provided by you.
- Serverless can be used to **automate the CI/CD pipeline** that gets triggered upon a code -check-in. The code check-in event can drive multiple function invocations in the pipeline such as - code security and other checks, build, test, and then deploy the code in production.

## Why should I use Serverless?

- Fast experimentation (Idea -> Market)
    - Serverless model as the highest level of abstraction allows you to quickly develop and deploy just your business logic for quick validation.
- Automatically scale from zero to peak demands
    - If successful you can scale up and down automatically driven by customer demand and not you.
- No idling of resources means you never overpay
    - Since you pay-by-value, you don't have to worry about overpaying.
# Containers

## What is a container?

- A way of packaging your application code and all its dependencies as a **single deployable unit.** It's called a container since you can ship it anywhere and run it either on-prem or cloud with just the underlying Operating system as a substrate.
- Containers are **lightweight abstractions** providing isolation from each other so multiple apps with their own set of dependencies on different libraries can run at the same time on the host hardware and operating system.

## Why should I use Containers?

- In the pre-container world, one of the struggles that the engineering and ops team had was making the development and production environment identical. Developers would build and test in the dev/test environment but things would fail in the production environment leading to a long cycle of troubleshooting. Containers eliminate that problem.
- Since containers can be deployed anywhere, with container orchestration technology such as Kubernetes, a container can be moved to any compute instance. This dynamic deployment flexibility helps maximize the utilization of compute instances.
- Containers by definition are portable so you can deploy them anywhere - on-prem or cloud. You can even move them across clouds making your investments more cloud-neutral.

## Use Cases

Container technology is rapidly getting adopted across multiple use cases.

- **Containerize current apps**: To drive agility, reduce deployment errors and maximize resource efficiency, companies are packaging their existing apps into containers and using an orchestrator like Kubernetes to deploy containers in on-prem as well as the cloud.
    
- **Microservices:** An application architecture concept where you have small pieces of functionality to provide a service that interacts with other services only through APIs. For instance, an e-commerce application can consist of several microservices such as
    
    - a shopping cart
    - search
    - order
    - payments
    - product recommendations Each microservice can be built using a different language or technology stack allowing the developers flexibility of what works the best for them. Containers provide an easy way to package and deploy microservices.
- Since containers are portable as we discussed, many companies use them for **Hybrid or Multi-cloud** scenarios. As your deployment choices evolve, you don't need to do much rework on your apps if they are already containerized.
    

### Combining serverless and containers

Some CSPs allow you to run your containers in a serverless environment, allowing you to take advantage of the potential capabilities of both at the same time

### Challenges

Managing thousands of containers for resource management, security and compliance, and cost allocation can be challenging.

Make sure you set up governance using CSP services or third party offerings

# Data Lake and Analytics

## What is a data lake?

If you are an on-prem enterprise, you probably have silos of data across your enterprise locked into different systems. A Data Lake is a unified repository of all of your structured and unstructured data.

As you can see in the image below, data pipelines "feed" the data lake from the bottom

- From all sources of data such as your **on-prem data** sources,
- **Real-time data** coming from devices, sensors, logs, etc to populate your data lake. CSPs provide a highly reliable and resilient storage infrastructure to build your data lake.

Services you can use based on that data

- You can build your **Machine Learning Models**
- Analytics can run on top of the data lake using services provided by the CSP.

![Data Lake](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60512a91_datalake/datalake.png)

Data Lake

## Why should I build a Data Lake?

- Generate **new insights** for the business: Insights that were difficult to surface can now be surfaced with relative ease as you build analytics over your data lake that span across ALL of your data - structured as well as unstructured data.
- Build **machine learning models**: Having your data lake in the cloud streamlines your ML flows allowing you rapidly build, train and deploy ML models utilizing the data in the data lake.
- Build innovative **data-driven apps:** The creation of new innovative apps is a lot easier as your apps now have access to all the data with relative ease. Data Lake in a way democratizes the data empowering everyone in your organization to use data to make business decisions.

## Use Cases

- **Complex analytic queries**: If your data is spread across multiple silos it becomes super difficult to run queries against those multiple silos. Creating a data lake makes running complex business queries against structured and unstructured data easy and fast. As a result, _**your decision-making is faster and is data-driven.**_ Companies across all industries such as _Netflix, Equinix, Adobe, Pfizer, Moderna_ use cloud-based data lakes and analytics to discover business insights and deliver great customer experiences.
- **Real-time analytics**: Processing massive real-time data to gather insights and take action in near real-time isn't easy with conventional technologies. Cloud providers provide services that take away the heavy lifting associated with real-time data handling so you can focus on delivering great customer experiences. For instance, _Netflix_ analyzes data from all its viewers across the globe in real-time using cloud services, allowing it to discover issues and address them quickly delivering a great customer experience.
- **Operational analytics**: Whether you run an e-commerce site or other online operations, analyzing operational data through logs and clickstream is super important to discover operational issues and deliver a great customer experience. Companies such as _Intuit, Autodesk, CoinBase, Expedia_ all use cloud services for operational insights.

## On-prem vs. cloud solution

How much time, cost, and effort it is to expand your data lake with 4 nine availability, extremely high durability, security, compliance, and audit capabilities, and with multiple storage tiers to optimize cost?

Think about the services you need to build to ingest data, manipulate data, query data, and the operational cost and challenges? Does the heavy lifting add any value to your business? The cloud can help you build and secure your own data lake in days instead of months.

In the next section, we discuss Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning services that nicely integrate with the data lake and related services to build, train and deploy your ML models to provide great customer experiences in a fraction of a time compared to doing it on-prem.

# A.I. & M.L.

There are two types of developers who will find value in using (A)rtificial (I)ntelligence and (M)achine (L)earning.

## Developer with A.I. and M.L. experience

- **If you are:** a developer with ML experience or you are a data scientist,
- **Who wants to**: build, train and deploy a model...
- **CSPs offer:** many ML services that are well integrated with ML infrastructure and frameworks such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, MxNet, etc. In addition, as we discussed earlier, data lake also becomes a big enabler within these cloud services providing seamless access to your data to build and train models.
- **Benefits**: Cloud not only removes complexity from your ML workflow but also allows you to speed up your model building, training, and deployment cycle. For instance, the availability of specialized processors called GPUs is important to accelerate the model training as well as inference time. CSPs are constantly adding the latest generation specialized processors allowing you to stay on the cutting edge.

---

## Developers with No A.I. and M.L. experience

- **If you are:** a developer an application developer with no machine learning background,
- **Who wants to:** infuse AI into your apps
- **CSPs offer**: ready-to-use AI services with pre-trained models offered through simple APIs you can use in your apps. The services span across areas such as Vision, Language, or Text. The services have been expanding to cover purpose-built AI solutions for industries. For instance, industrial companies who want to improve uptime for the plant, can deploy predictive maintenance solutions from the cloud provider in their plants and use the predictive maintenance AI services in their applications to predict failures.
- **Benefits**: You can significantly improve your operations or deliver new customer experiences avoiding the complexity of AI and ML workflows. The CSP takes care of the Machine Learning and data science behind the scenes to continuously improve the accuracy of AI services offered.

## Use Cases.

- **Predictive Analytics** is based on using historical data to predict the future. It's frequently used in customer lifecycle management to predict if a customer is likely to churn, or specific offerings that can drive growth via cross-selling. In the financial industry, it is used to assess the underwriting risk based on a prediction of bankruptcy or fraud, etc.
- **Predictive Maintainance**: Equipment failures can be catastrophic leading to production losses, unhappy customers, and other negative consequences for your business. Predictive maintenance allows you to predict if a piece of equipment is likely to fail so you can take appropriate action before it fails. It is used by many industrial and manufacturing companies.
- **Supply chain efficiency**: When inventories pile up lagging demand, companies suffer losses. Similarly, inventory shortages can lead to unhappy customers. Using AI in demand forecasting and dynamic network planning can lead to optimal supply chain and logistics for all companies.
- **Fraud Detection:** According to a recent survey from PwC, the fraud losses amounted to $42 billion in the US over the last 2 years. Companies can mitigate many fraud cases by deploying AI. Many financial companies use AI to detect credit card fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes.
- **Customer Experiences**: Many customer experiences are being powered by AI across all industries. No need to tell who you are when you call customer care as AI can recognize your voice and bring up all your recent data. Product searches are no longer just typing a description of the product in a search bar, you can take a picture say on eBay and Amazon app, and the system will find similar things for you.

## A.I. and M.L. as electricity powering your organization

There is tremendous innovation happening in the AI/ML area across academia, industry, startups, government. Cloud providers are constantly adding new services bringing all the innovation in a form that's easy to consume by you. So, if YOU are not taking advantage of it, someone else in your industry is and they would likely leapfrog you. While you can do AI on-prem, moving your A.I. to the cloud is a smarter choice; it is easier to stay competitive given the cost and effort required to assemble the building blocks before you can deliver AI-driven experiences to your customers. CSPs take away a lot of heavy lifting behind AI and ML, allowing you to focus on your business innovation.

# IoT

## Internet of Things

#### What is IoT?

Internet of things refers to billions of devices and sensors connected over the internet, collecting and sharing data that's used to drive decisions or outcomes. If you have home automation with smart bulbs, smart switches, smart surveillance cameras, smart thermostats, and possibly something like Alexa or Google Home, you are getting the benefits of IoT already.

When you have billions of sensors and devices collecting data, you require very specialized infrastructure to not only control and manage these devices but also gather, store and analyze real-time data coming from these devices. Cloud provides you the services to do that efficiently.

### Why should we use IoT?

- **Deliver new customer experiences:** Many companies use IoT to deliver new customer experiences. For instance, iRobot, a robotics vacuum cleaner company uses IoT to deliver great customer experiences. Customers can use a mobile app or smart home device such as Alexa to manage the vacuum cleaner, find it if it gets stuck somewhere, schedule cleaning, etc.
- **Predictive Maintainance:** We discussed predictive maintenance earlier in the ML section. Otis, the leading elevator company, uses IoT on the cloud to do predictive maintenance of its 2 million elevators across the world. As a result, They are able to significantly reduce elevator downtime, delivering a better customer experience and reducing their own operational costs.
- **Operational Insights:** Many companies collect operational data from their equipment to see how customers use them so they can learn and make improvements in product designs. Data-driven decision-making in product design leads to optimal investments in product designs maximizing customer delights and reducing wasted spend on features sparingly used by customers.

### Use Cases

![I.O.T. Use Cases](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60512af1_iot-use-cases/iot-use-cases.png)

I.O.T. Use Cases

- **Home Automation**
    - Home automation is one of the most common use cases for IoT. We earlier talked about iRobot, the robotic vacuum company. Rachio, a smart watering system company, provides a full IoT solution in the cloud that includes smart moisture sensors, controllers, weather forecasting system to design an automated and intelligent watering plan for your backyard.
- **Smart Factories**
    - We talked about Predictive Maintainance earlier. Predictive maintenance can reduce downtime leading to happier customers and reduced operating costs for you. The concept of Smart Factories goes much beyond predictive maintenance. It also means using IOT data to optimize factory functions for improving factory productivity. For instance, Volkswagen group, an automobile company, uses IoT on the cloud to improve the operations of all of its factories through data collected from sensors leading to a reduction of factory costs and a 30% increase in productivity.
- **Smart Cities**
    - Imagine a city where traffic signals are dynamically self-optimized depending on traffic conditions, authorities can respond to accidents and maintenance incidents faster. Many cities have active projects implementing these IoT-driven solutions on the cloud.
- **Health Monitoring**
    - Many healthcare device manufacturers are building IOT enabled devices for remote monitoring of patient health. This IoT solution delivers better patient care and timely response to health issues, connecting caregivers to patients in ways not possible before.
# Blockchain

## What is Blockchain

Blockchain conceptually is an **immutable distributed ledger** that allows multiple parties to engage in trusted transactions without having a central party acting as a trusted authority.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin use Blockchain as the underlying technology to conduct payment transactions without an intermediary such as a bank.

## Why should I use Blockchain?

- To build apps on blockchain, you need to build and secure a blockchain network requiring quite a bit of work. Maintaining and expanding the blockchain network as your blockchain ecosystem expands is also no-trivial.
- A Cloud provider helps eliminate the complexity associated with setting up and maintaining blockchain networks allowing you to build ledger applications.
- Think about what problems in your business you can potentially solve and experiment using blockchain on the cloud. For instance, if you have supply chain issues such as counterfeit goods, compliance violations, waste, or delays, you may want to think of solving them using blockchain. There are a variety of use cases in multiple industries where blockchain-based apps can shine.

## Use Cases

### Supply Chain

- **Transparency**: Every industry has a supply chain and therefore ensuring the authenticity of products and components as they move through the chain, avoiding wastes, and ensuring quality are all supply chain issues companies struggle with. Nestle, a European food company, well known for its coffee brands, was faced with similar supply chain issues. They also wanted to bring more transparency to the supply chain for its consumers to verify things such as the origin of coffee time of harvest, transaction certificate for the specific shipments, as well as the roasting period.
- **Trust**: Nestle turned to a Blockchain-based solution to provide the trust its buyers needed for the coffee and food items they consume. They used blockchain's transactional transparency and trust as an enabler for delivering an innovative experience for its buyers. By simply scanning a QR code, buyers can access the supply chain history of the food or coffee they just bought.

![The Complexity of DRM](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60512bc6_ccbl-c1-drm-problem/ccbl-c1-drm-problem.png)

The Complexity of DRM

Sony Music uses a digital rights management system. DRM and copyright verification are critical to ensuring artists are compensated for their work.

## The problem

You can this demonstrated in the image above -- the old method of contracts across multiple parties involved in the production and distribution of music to ensure digital rights is ripe with problems and leads to high costs for the creator of the music.

Follow along in the image above: Here is what this system looks like

- Copyright ownership begins with the creator at the genesis of the content.
- From there, it can then be sold or transferred to other parties.
- The system of record must be able to verify the copyright owner and enable compensation for use of the material under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.

## How does a Blockchain-based DRM platform work?

![Blockchain Solution](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/60512be2_ccbl-c1-drm-solution/ccbl-c1-drm-solution.png)

Blockchain Solution

The image above conveys the solution to this complex system in a _Blockchain-based DRM platform_. How does this work?

- Composers copyright is recorded in the BC system
- When the individual acquires rights to the content, the provider’s system adds a new block in the network representing those rights.
- The provider can then send the encrypted music data, which can be decoded after verification against the user’s rights blockchain.
- This streamlines the DRM process allowing artists to focus on the production of music knowing the system will protect their rights and compensate them for their work adequately.

## Future of Blockchain

Blockchain is a relatively new technology and use cases are still emerging. There are companies building identity verification solutions on blockchain. Financial services companies are looking at simplifying trading and creating innovative payment solutions. Smart contracts that don't require any intermediary and distributed ledger have great potential to transform all industries and the public sector as well. McKinsey, a leading management consultancy firm has ranked public sector, technology, media, telecom, and financial services industries where the ease of adoption and potential impact is going to be relatively high compared to others.


# Edge Computing

![Edge Computing](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/July/60dde689_ccbl2/ccbl2.png)

Edge Computing

In the image above, you can see that Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data closer to the location where it is needed to improve response time and save bandwidth.

- **Cloud Layer**
    - A typical architectural pattern is for AI models to get trained in the cloud, and get deployed on the edge for inferencing.
- **Edge Layer**
    - There are other use cases for edge computing such as management of IoT devices, storage and caching of data, and doing certain compute offload functions such as resizing images based on the requesting device type.
- **Device Layer**
    - Actual end devices such as cars, drones, and surveillance cameras can send real-time data such as video feeds for inference on the edge for quick response time.

## Why should I use Edge Computing?

- Managed service eliminates the complexity of edge deployments
    - The cloud players are realizing the significance of edge computing and are extending their cloud model to "cloud and the edge" by providing cloud-based programming models, APIs, etc to developers to give them the flexibility to deploy the apps in the cloud or the edge.
    - Cloud providers have recently announced new services for edge computing such as AWS Wavelength or Azure Edge Zones and are forging partnerships with telecom operators to provide end-to-end edge computing solutions. Building this edge computing model with right-edge locations, network access, application ecosystem would be very difficult otherwise.
- Innovative apps to deliver new customer experiences or improve operations.
    - Edge computing unlocks new innovation opportunities. A smart factory where real-time decisions need to be made can't afford the latencies of the cloud.. edge computing lights up those scenarios, improving your operations. Gaming where latencies matter a lot to deliver interactive real-time experiences to gamers is another example. An entirely new set of experiences with augmented and virtual reality are now possible in any location such as a department store.

![Edge Computing use cases](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2021/March/6051338e_edsge-use-case/edsge-use-case.png)

Edge Computing use cases

## Use Cases

While edge computing combined with 5G as the new radio access technology is relatively new, it's already showing the potential for solving problems and enabling new experiences in almost all industries.

### Healthcare

Let's take Healthcare as an example. A startup in the USA has built an edge solution that would allow doctors to do a colonoscopy and detect hard-to-find polyps using AI. The way the solution works is as follows - video feed from the endoscope is sent over 5G network to a closeby edge computing location where an AI model runs to identify polyps. The results are sent back in near real-time allowing the doctor to finish the colonoscopy and deliver better results improving patient care.

### Smart factories

We touched upon Volkwagen when we discussed IoT. Volkswagen is also using edge computing to improve factory operations. The devices in the factory send data to edge equipment running AI inferencing models to assist with real-time decision-making. Imagine the power of this architecture. You can automate so many processes. You can send video feeds to check for anomalies and do quality checks in the assembly line with AI.

## Edge Computing: The new frontier for innovation

Edge computing use cases are in all industries. Companies in all industries such as Agriculture, Healthcare, Retail, Finance, Public Sector, Industrial are all looking at use cases enabled by 5G rollout, Multi-access edge computing, and advances in AI/ML. Cloud simplifies the complexity of building and deploying edge applications by bringing all these elements together in partnership with leading telecom companies such as AT&T, SK Telecom, Verizon, KDDI, etc.

Edge is rapidly becoming the new frontier for innovation. New business models are emerging. I encourage you to think about use cases relevant to your industry and try them out with your cloud provider.

`The cost of experimentation in the cloud is very low and the payoff could be very high.`

# Exercise Cloud Innovation Services

## Cloud innovation services

Pick any 3 of the recent cloud innovation services (Serverless computing, Containers, IoT, Data Analytics, AI and ML, Blockchain as a service, Edge computing). Describe how you’d use each of the three to innovate in your business. Also list the business benefits of each (e.g. new revenue stream, improved customer experience, higher operational efficiency, etc)

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

## Solution

Serverless computing: I’d encourage my staff to conduct experiments and create new apps using Serverless technologies. Serverless dramatically improves TTM as there is nothing else to build or manage other than application logic. I can do more experiments with fewer people. Serverless would improve our operational efficiency.

AI as a service: My company is in the eCommerce space. A new feature we added recently is called “Image Search” which allows customers to upload an image of an object they like (dress, shoes, pots, etc), and our site provides a list of matching items in our inventory. This feature was built using machine learning (Computer vision) technologies.

I would use the Cloud provider’s machine learning stack (specialized hardware for training the models as well as inference, ML software, and the entire data science automation from development to production) would accelerate the feature release lifecycle. I can scale up and down quickly on the cloud with my model complexity and improve object match accuracy. In addition, I can deploy it in local geographies improving the response time and customer experience. The major business benefit is customer experience.

Edge Computing: With edge computing, we can deliver new shopping experiences in our retail stores. Customers can virtually try before they buy using Augmented reality (AR) technologies, Edge computing locations allow us to build AR applications and deploy them on multiple Edge locations provided by the cloud provider. We can significantly enhance our customer experiences with Edge Computing.

# Best Practice and Expert Intuition

## Best Practices and Expert Intuition

`Cloud is not just a technology... it's a way of running your business.`

Innovating in your business is key to staying relevant in this fast-paced world. Here are a few considerations to keep in mind as you think about innovating with the cloud.

### Complexity

While cloud providers do an excellent job of doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes for all innovation, you still need to understand the risks and complexities of the adoption of these innovative services. Each innovation will deliver tremendous value when architected right, and supported by good governance. Security, compliance, and cost management issues apply to the solutions you build utilizing these services. For instance, while containers are great, they expose new attack surfaces which fall into the shared responsibility model. You need to understand your part and ensure you take care of container security starting from your CI/CD pipeline before the containers get deployed in production.

### Risk and Rewards

Cloud significantly changes the risk/reward ratio. The cost of experimentation in the cloud is much lower than in on-prem. And if the experiment succeeds, the payoff is likely bigger as you can quickly scale and ramp up capacity. This should tie back to the culture in your organization which should evolve with this new paradigm, and encourages more risk-taking.

### Sandboxes

Innovation can't be forced or run as a program. Ideas can come from anywhere if you remove barriers, and give everyone a chance to build something. Providing sandboxes and letting people set aside some time for skunkwork projects, can be worth the effort.

### Democratize data

Innovation can suffer if people can't access company data. Creating a data lake and providing secure and controlled mechanisms for people to access data would remove a key barrier to innovation.

### Constant change

You are never done in the cloud. You need to keep re-architecting your existing services as new cloud services show up. For instance, AWS pioneered the cloud computing model with just one service S3 in 2006 and now has 200+ services, and are constantly adding more services and features to existing services. Other cloud providers are also doing the same. Keeping up with the pace of innovation in the cloud world requires a cultural and mindset change.

# Exercise Identifying Current Innovations

## Current Innovations

Identify one product, service, or application from your company that you consider innovative. Describe it in a few sentences and highlight what aspect of it do you consider to be innovative. If you were to rebuild it utilizing cloud capabilities, what specific cloud innovative capabilities would you leverage? What’s the business benefit of building it on the cloud (faster build, global scale, etc) compared to the traditional model?

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

## Sample Solution 1

# Lesson Review

## Lesson review

Looking back at what we studied:

- We looked at some business trends and saw how the increased pace of innovation is driving disruption in all industries.
- We discussed how some of the characteristics of the cloud are well suited for innovation
- We looked at some of the major cloud services that are being utilized to drive innovation. We also covered some typical use cases across all industry segments that are apt for these cloud services
- We shared some best practices to drive innovation in your organization.

## Case Study

While we are done with the final lesson on innovation, we are not done learning. We are going to introduce you to Capital One and look back at the journey they took as they transformed their business model into the cloud.

# Business Case Study

## Business Use Case

video below will have bullet points added at 3:20 , 3:40

## Capital One

This case study brings everything together we have learned in the course.

This is the story of Capital One, one of the leading financial services companies in the US, ranked 97 in Fortune 500 companies. The reason I picked this story is for _two reasons:_

- It exemplifies all major areas we covered in the course from building the business case to organizational capability building to setting up governance and delivering innovative services.
- It's a financial services company that is highly regulated in the US.

Regardless of the industry, you are in, I hope the story inspires you to not be intimidated by the complexity of your business situation, operating rules, and industry regulations and _instead_ make a bold move to the cloud.

### Building the business case for cloud

#### The role of technology

They believed in technology as a core and not a support function for the business. This meant beefing up the technology capabilities so they can be a technology company first before being a bank.

CapitalOne is mostly a digital bank with very few branches in select locations in the US. They have grown software engineering organizations to 11,000 engineers and wanted to focus on customer experiences and not running infrastructure and operations.

#### New customer experiences

CapitalOne built the business case on speed and delivering new customer experiences. in 2015, it announced that all new company applications would run in, and all existing applications would be systematically rearchitected for—the cloud. They set a goal to retire all of their 8 datacenters to be all-in on the cloud by 2020.

`They have accomplished their goal.`

#### TCO

As we covered in the course, the business case for the cloud shouldn't just be built on just the financial aspects of TCO. In the Capital One case, While the business case factored in cost savings from data centers, but the **business agility** and desire to deliver new experiences is what drove the public cloud decision.

### Leadership

In this course, we talked about how important it is to have a strong C-level exec sponsor who needs to be personally vested in the cloud-led transformation. In the Capital One case, George Brady, EVP, and CTO of Capital One was the exec sponsor. He enlisted support from other leaders by championing the value of the cloud:

- Supports faster innovation
- Support saving and finding value in more data
- Supports faster recovery from failures
- Supports shifting resources from operations to higher-value work.

Once other leaders were enlisted, things became easier as everyone was working towards a common mission to turn Capital One first into a tech company as well as a bank.

### Cultural transformation

In this course, we discussed the importance of cultural transformation and mindset changes needed to operate well in the cloud. A big part of the cultural transformation we advocated was

- DevOps
- DevSecOps

In the CapitalOne case, incorporating customer feedback into new experiences used to take a long time in the earlier more traditional waterfall method at CapitalOne. The developer engagement ended after handing it off to operations. The product managers weren't as engaged in the development cycle. CapitalOne rebooted the developer culture to adopt a DevOps mindset.

### Moving to a DevOps mindset

They saw the immediate benefits of how quickly they can turn customer feedback into features. Developers developed a more sense of ownership for uptime and monitoring of the services in production. Product managers are now more engaged and collaborative with DevOps teams to turn customer feedback into features quickly. This culture also was instrumental in attracting new talent to CapitalOne.

### A culture of learning

Transitioning People to new roles and skills enablement was another pillar we covered in the course. And this education should not be limited to technical roles but business roles as well.

In the CapitalOne case, targeted training and education for technical professionals, as well as business executives, was launched. A _culture of learning_ where employees invested working hours in getting cloud certifications was instituted. In addition, targeted workshops and other learning events were launched throughout the company.

_Clearly, all of this wouldn't have been possible without strong executive sponsorship, as we discussed in the course._

### Putting governance in place

In this course, we discussed the importance of governance. In CapitalOne's case, they didn't move a single workload until their governance model was in place.

A risk-averse attitude would be to first run non-core systems in the cloud leaving critical data and apps on-prem. Instead, CapitalOne tackled upfront the hard problems of:

- Security
- Compliance

### Team collaborations

As we had discussed earlier in this course, the people and process aspects are very important for governance. CapitalOne tasked risk managers and cloud engineers to collaborate in building controls and processes so the developer teams can build new experiences with appropriate security and compliance guardrails.

### "Cloud Custodian"

They also developed and open-sourced a compliance enforcement framework called "Cloud Custodian". Prior to Cloud Custodian, different teams were building scripts and custom code to establish compliance which was cumbersome. Cloud Custodian simplified and standardized compliance framework across CapitalOne.

### Innovation

As we discussed in the course, the key motivation to move to the cloud should be to innovate faster leveraging cloud services. Capital One has been doing that effectively now that they are _all-in_ with the cloud.

#### New customer experiences

With all of its data on the cloud, CapitalOne has built several new customer experiences using **data analytics** and **machine learning** services of the cloud provider. For example, they built "Eno" a digital assistant to track spending, provide fraud alerts, save you money, and answer any questions. Eno is built on **serverless technologies** from its cloud provider along with several **machine learning** and **A.I.** capabilities.

### The journey continues

CapitalOne cloud journey continues but surely they, _and their customers,_ are happy with the move as they are now able to innovate much faster on the cloud.

Please continue to use the template `Exercise Template.docx` or `Exercise Template.txt` to record your responses. This is located under the Resources section of the course, in the top left of this page.

## Sample Solution

In this sample response, I picked: [(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/arneg/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)[https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/arneg/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/arneg/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card)

**Key pain point:** On-prem alerting systems would send alarms only when refrigeration was malfunctioning. This put pressure on Arneg to respond quickly and resulted in customer downtime. Arneg wanted to predict failures with a high degree of accuracy to improve customer experience and overall operational efficiency. They were able to innovate with architecture on the cloud that addressed this pain point.

List of steps if the same thing were to be solved using on-prem(ise) solution:

- Hire a team of data scientists and ML experts.
- Buy specialized hardware (GPUs) and other infrastructure to build the predictive maintenance model.
- Buy massive storage to collect and store data from IoT records.
- Build a toolchain for data science and a process for the iterative process of training the model and dropping it into production.
- Deploy production infrastructure in all the sites/geographies where it had a presence.
- Make everything redundant and highly available.

# 5. Bintoso's Cloud Transformation

# Introduction

## Bintoso’s Cloud Transformation

## Introduction

Bintoso was founded in 1978 as a clothing store in North Carolina. Over the years, it has expanded as a department store serving US customers. They have recently expanded into select locations in Europe.

## Problems facing Bintoso

- Bintoso faces stiff competition from other department stores as well as online retailers.
- The revenues and margins have been trending down.
- The company closed many stores and laid off 10% of its workforce in the last 2 years.
- Bintoso was late in starting its digital transformation journey.

Simone Warel, the new CEO hired last year from a leading online retailer is transforming the company to provide a multi-channel experience.

## Your challenge

Your task is to analyze and propose a cloud strategy for Bintoso. You will be provided multiple artifacts such as:

- Detailed company backgrounder
- Recent income statement
- CEO email exchanges with staff highlighting business challenges and opportunities
- Hierarchical organizational charts
- Email exchanges illustrating culture and siloed mindset
- Financial information on current and upcoming data center costs
- Workload map to Data Centers

You are expected to analyze all artifacts to glean meaningful information to build a cloud strategy. The strategy should cover all core learning objectives

- Identify business problems best addressed with cloud
- Prioritize workloads to maximize ROI
- Define the org model and needed changes in skill levels and processes
- Define a governance model that would mitigate risks and optimize spend
- Propose a new innovative solution on the cloud that would deliver new business benefits (e.g. new revenue stream, improved customer experience, improve operational excellence, etc.)

### Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out

1. Assume all workloads for Bintoso are now in the cloud, and you have the power to define the new org chart. What would it look like?
    
2. Assume you are the CIO of Bintoso. Bintoso, just acquired a niche online retailer to augment its own online capabilities. The acquired company is on a different cloud provider. How would you handle the situation? Consider people, process, technology implications of your decision when coming up with an answer.
